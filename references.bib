abstract = {Abstract Purpose To validate the Clouclip, a continuously measuring objective rangefinder, and examine viewing behaviours during various near tasks in non-myopic and myopic adults. Methods In experiment 1, five Clouclip devices were utilised. An infrared camera was used to visualise and measure infrared beam size and angle. Repeatability for distance tracking was assessed from 5 to 120 cm in 5 cm increments. Accuracy of distance tracking was investigated for paper and iPad targets, spatial integration was calculated, effects of target tilt were determined and light measurements were compared to a lux meter. In experiment 2, viewing behaviour was assessed in 41 subjects (21 non-myopic, 20 myopic) during four 15-min near tasks; (1) passive reading of printed material, (2) active writing on printed material, (3) passive viewing on an electronic device and (4) active engagement on an electronic device. Working distance was compared between tasks and refractive error groups. Results Clouclip distance tracking showed good repeatability, with a mean difference of 0.34 cm and limits of agreement of ±2.0 cm. Clouclip-measured and actual distances were highly correlated for paper and electronic targets from 5 to 120 cm, with mean differences and limits of agreement of 3.96 ± 13.78 cm and 4.48 ± 8.92 cm, respectively; variability increased for distances >100 cm. Tracking ability increased with larger target sizes; tracking was accurate when the target occupied 1.5\%–20.3\% of tracking beam area, depending on distance and with target tilt up to ±60 degrees. Clouclip- and lux meter-measured ambient illumination were highly correlated for a wide range of intensities (r = 0.96, p < 0.001), but with greater variability for intensities >20 000 lux. The Clouclip infrared beam was measured to have a diameter of 25.6 ± 2.2° and a downward angle of 10.3 ± 0.5°. For subject testing, viewing distance was significantly closer for active and passive printed tasks (29.5 ± 6.7 cm and 33.2 ± 8.8 cm, respectively) than for active and passive electronic tasks (35.4 ± 8.0 cm and 40.8 ± 10.4 cm, respectively), with no differences between refractive error groups (p = 0.88). Conclusions The Clouclip performed well in measuring near and intermediate distances and could distinguish between indoor (<1000 lux) and outdoor (>1000 lux) illumination. A closer working distance was observed for printed tasks compared to those on an iPad, with no difference in viewing distance between non-myopic and myopic adults.},

Clouclip, a wearable device, was applied to assess metrics of these two factors in 78 fifth-grade students from an urban and from a rural school.    The light intensity experienced by urban students was found significantly lower both in the school period (614.05 ± 178.77 vs. 918.41 ± 257.81 lux, P \&lt; 0.001) and on the weekend (444.53 ± 216.65 vs. 882.21 ± 536.67 lux, P \&lt; 0.001). The duration of exposure to bright light (\&gt;1000 lux) was also substantially shorter for urban students. Although no significant difference was found in near work–related behaviors during the school period and the weekend, for the after-school period the urban students had a shorter average viewing distance (30.94 ± 4.14 vs. 34.81 ± 3.93 cm, P \&lt; 0.001), a longer accumulated duration of near work (2.25 ± 0.53 vs. 1.95 ± 0.46 hours, P = 0.010), a greater time ratio of near work (56\% ± 14\% vs. 49\% ± 14\%, P = 0.045), and a greater time ratio of excessively close near work (49\% ± 13\% vs. 40\% ± 12\%, P = 0.001).    Our data indicate there were substantial differences in light exposure and near-work metrics between the two regions. The correlation between these differences and the discrepancy in regional myopia prevalence needs further investigation.    The objective quantification of these metrics might help explain the varied myopia prevalence among regions.  },

The mean daily Clouclip wearing time was 11.72{\textpm}1.14 hour.

    abstract = {Background Light exposure regulates the human circadian system and more widely affects health, well-being, and performance. With the rise in field studies on light exposure’s effects, the amount of data collected through wearable loggers and dosimeters has also grown. These data are more complex than stationary laboratory measurements. Determining sample sizes in field studies is challenging, as the literature shows a wide range of sample sizes (between 2 and 1,887 from a recent review of the field and approaching 105 participants in first studies using large-scale ‘biobank’ databases). Current decisions on sample size for light exposure data collection lack a specific basis rooted in power analysis. Therefore, there is a need for clear guidance on selecting sample sizes.   Methods Here, we introduce a novel procedure based on hierarchical bootstrapping for calculating statistical power and required sample size for wearable light and optical radiation logging data and derived summary metrics, taking into account the hierarchical data structure (mixed-effects model) through stepwise resampling. Alongside this method, we publish a dataset that serves as one possible basis to perform these calculations: one week of continuous data in winter and summer, respectively, for 13 early-day shift-work participants (collected in Dortmund, Germany; lat. 51.514° N, lon. 7.468° E).   Results Applying our method on the dataset for twelve different summary metrics (luminous exposure, geometric mean, and standard deviation, timing/time above/below threshold, mean/midpoint of darkest/brightest hours, intradaily variability) with a target comparison across winter and summer, reveals required sample sizes ranging from as few as 3 to more than 50. About half of the metrics–those that focus on the bright time of day–showed sufficient power already with the smallest sample. In contrast, metrics centered around the dark time of the day and daily patterns required higher sample sizes: mean timing of light below mel EDI of 10 lux (5), intradaily variability (17), mean of darkest 5 hours (24), and mean timing of light above mel EDI of 250 lux (45). The geometric standard deviation and the midpoint of the darkest 5 hours lacked sufficient power within the tested sample size.   Conclusions Our novel method provides an effective technique for estimating sample size in light exposure studies. It is specific to the used light exposure or dosimetry metric and the effect size inherent in the light exposure data at the basis of the bootstrap. Notably, the method goes beyond typical implementations of bootstrapping to appropriately address the structure of the data. It can be applied to other datasets, enabling comparisons across scenarios beyond seasonal differences and activity patterns. With an ever-growing pool of data from the emerging literature, the utility of this method will increase and provide a solid statistical basis for the selection of sample sizes.},

abstract = {Abstract Purpose To evaluate the rangefinding and light sensing capabilities of a novel wearable sensor, the Visual Environment Evaluation Tool (VEET) developed for myopia research. Methods The VEET 1.0 (Meta, LLC) is a temple-integrated system mounted on a spectacle frame. Both the left and right temples house four sensors each, angled straight ahead and 20° downward/4° nasal, respectively. For validation, VEET-mounted spectacles were placed on a mannequin head. An infrared camera was used to capture the spatial characteristics of the rangefinding beam. Distance measurements were collected against a wall for 5–400 cm. The accuracy of distance measurements for different target types, sizes and tilt was assessed. Ambient illumination was captured in different indoor and outdoor settings and compared to a lux meter. Results All devices (N = 20) were capable of capturing distances for the full range evaluated, 5–400 cm, against a wall. There was a strong relationship between the actual and measured distances, with a slope of 1.01 ± 0.003 and 0.95 ± 0.007, for the left and right temples, respectively. Distance measurements were repeatable across different target types, including paper and tablet. Mean beam diameter of five tested devices was 52.2° ± 7.5°. The VEET effectively measured distances across different target sizes, ranging from 2 × 2 cm and larger and target tilt ±60°. Illumination measurements across different indoor and outdoor settings demonstrated a strong linear relationship with lux meter readings (R2 = 0.99 and 0.78 for the left and right temples, respectively), effectively distinguishing indoor (<1000 lux) and outdoor (≥1000 lux) illumination levels. Conclusion The VEET provides accurate quantification of real-time distances across different target types and sizes and is capable of effectively distinguishing indoor and outdoor illumination levels. The VEET will be valuable in studies evaluating risk factors for myopia to gain a better understanding of the role of near work and light exposure.}

abstract = {Abstract Purpose To validate a novel wearable device that can measure both viewing distance and light exposure, Clouclip, and compare questionnaire estimates regarding near-work and outdoor time with the objective measures obtained using Clouclip. Methods Fifteen Clouclips were selected to measure different distances and levels of illuminance. With each Clouclip, five measurements at different distances and light intensities were measured and recorded. Eighty participants wore Clouclips for a week and completed an activity questionnaire afterwards. Results The intra- and inter-Clouclip coefficients were 1.00 and 0.99 for measuring distance and 1.00 and 1.00 for illuminance, respectively. Within the measurement limit, the maximum relative error was 2.07\% for distance and 2.23\% for illuminance. Assuming that <30 cm was the typical distance for near-work activities and >1000 Lux was the typical cut-off for outdoor environments, the questionnaire showed a trend of overestimation for both. The greatest overestimation of near-work occurred during the school period [Questionnaire: 4.73 hr (4.73, 5.07) versus Clouclip: 2.16 hr (1.74, 2.78); p < 0.01]. The greatest overestimation of outdoor activity also occurred during the school period [Questionnaire: 1.60 hr (1.33, 1.85) versus Clouclip: 1.21 hr (0.96, 1.50); p < 0.01]. Based on Clouclip, the total time spent outdoors was estimated to be 1.55 hr on school days, of which 0.34 hr occurred after school. For weekend days, however, the duration was only 0.17 hr. Conclusions Clouclip had excellent precision and accuracy. Although the agreement between the questionnaire and Clouclip was relatively poor, they were able to complement each other to provide a more logical and feasible assessment of exposure to near-work and outdoor activity. Indoor-oriented lifestyles were found to predominate in Chinese children.},

   abstract = {Light profoundly impacts many aspects of human physiology and behaviour, including the synchronization of the circadian clock, the production of melatonin, and cognition. These effects of light, termed the non-visual effects of light, have been primarily investigated in laboratory settings, where light intensity, spectrum and timing can be carefully controlled to draw associations with physiological outcomes of interest. Recently, the increasing availability of wearable light loggers has opened the possibility of studying personal light exposure in free-living conditions where people engage in activities of daily living, yielding findings associating aspects of light exposure and health outcomes, supporting the importance of adequate light exposure at appropriate times for human health. However, comprehensive protocols capturing environmental (e.g., geographical location, season, climate, photoperiod) and individual factors (e.g., culture, personal habits, behaviour, commute type, profession) contributing to the measured light exposure are currently lacking. Here, we present a protocol that combines smartphone-based experience sampling (experience sampling implementing Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS ratings) and high-quality light exposure data collection at three body sites (near-corneal plane between the two eyes mounted on spectacle, neck-worn pendant/badge, and wrist-worn watch-like design) to capture daily factors related to individuals' light exposure. We will implement the protocol in an international multi-centre study to investigate the environmental and socio-cultural factors influencing light exposure patterns in Germany, Ghana, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey (minimum n = 15, target n = 30 per site, minimum n = 90, target n = 180 across all sites). With the resulting dataset, lifestyle and context-specific factors that contribute to healthy light exposure will be identified. This information is essential in designing effective public health interventions.},

With the emergence of wearable light loggers and dosimeters, research on real-world light exposure effects is growing. There is a critical need to standardize data collection and documentation across studies. RESULTS: This article proposes a new metadata descriptor designed to capture crucial information within personalized light exposure datasets collected with wearable light loggers and dosimeters. The descriptor, developed collaboratively by international experts, has a modular structure for future expansion and customization. It covers four key domains: study design, participant characteristics, dataset details, and device specifications. Each domain includes specific metadata fields for comprehensive documentation. The user-friendly descriptor is available in JSON format. A web interface simplifies generating compliant JSON files for broad accessibility. Version control allows for future improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our metadata descriptor empowers researchers to enhance the quality and value of their light dosimetry datasets by making them FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). Ultimately, its adoption will advance our understanding of how light exposure affects human physiology and behaviour in real-world settings.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Light exposure is an important driver and modulator of human physiology, behavior and overall health, including the biological clock, sleep-wake cycles, mood and alertness. Light can also be used as a directed intervention, e.g., in the form of light therapy in seasonal affective disorder (SAD), jetlag prevention and treatment, or to treat circadian disorders. Recently, a system of quantities and units related to the physiological effects of light was standardized by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE S 026/E:2018). At the same time, biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) to capture personalized light exposure were developed. However, because there are currently no standard approaches to evaluate the digital dosimeters, the need to provide a firm framework for the characterization, calibration, and reporting for these digital sensors is urgent. OBJECTIVE: This article provides such a framework by applying the principles of verification, analytic validation and clinical validation (V3) as a state-of-the-art approach for tools and standards in digital medicine to light dosimetry. RESULTS: This article describes opportunities for the use of digital dosimeters for basic research, for monitoring light exposure, and for measuring adherence in both clinical and non-clinical populations to light-based interventions in clinical trials.},

   abstract = {Light plays an important role in human health and well-being, which necessitates the study of the effects of personal light exposure in real-world settings, measured by means of wearable devices. A growing number of studies incorporate these kinds of data to assess associations between light and health outcomes. Yet with few or missing standards, guidelines, and frameworks, it is challenging setting up measurements, analysing the data, and comparing outcomes between studies. Overall, time series data from wearable light loggers are significantly more complex compared to controlled stimuli used in laboratory studies. In this paper, we introduce LightLogR, a novel resource to facilitate these research efforts. The package for R statistical software is open-source and permissively MIT-licenced. As part of a developing software ecosystem, LightLogR is built with common challenges of current and future datasets in mind. The package standardises many tasks for importing and processing personal light exposure data. It allows for quick as well as detailed insights into the datasets through summary and visualisation tools. Furthermore, LightLogR incorporates major metrics commonly used in the field (61 metrics across 17 metric families), all while embracing an inherently hierarchical, participant-based data structure.},

Metadata standards are one foundation for the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles of data management. They facilitate data discovery, understanding, and reuse. However, the adoption of metadata standards in biological research lags in practice. Barriers such as complexity, lack of incentives, technical challenges, resource constraints, and resistance to change hinder widespread adoption. In the field of chronobiology, standardization is essential but faces particular challenges due to the longitudinal nature of experimental data, diverse model organisms, and varied measurement techniques. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that emphasizes simplicity and practicality: the development of README templates tailored for particular data types and species. Through this opinion article, our intention is to initiate a dialogue and commence a community-driven standardization process by engaging potential contributors and collaborators.},

Insights from laboratory studies have recently culminated in standards and guidelines for measuring and assessing healthy light exposure, and recommendations for healthy light levels. Implicit to laboratory paradigms is a simplistic input-output relationship between light and its effects on physiology. This simplified approach ignores that humans actively shape their light exposure through behaviour. This article presents a novel framework that conceptualises light exposure as an individual behaviour to meet specific, person-based needs. Key to healthy light exposure is shaping behaviour, beyond shaping technology.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: In the past few decades, the prevalence of myopia, where the eye grows too long, has increased dramatically. The visual environment appears to be critical to regulating the eye growth. Thus, it is very important to determine the properties of the environment that put children at risk for myopia. Researchers have suggested that the intensity of illumination and range of distances to which a child's eyes are exposed are important, but this has not been confirmed. METHODS: We designed, built, and tested an inexpensive, child-friendly, head-mounted device that can measure the intensity and spectral content of illumination approaching the eyes and can also measure the distances to which the central visual field of the eyes are exposed. The device is mounted on a child's bicycle helmet. It includes a camera that measures distances over a substantial range and a six-channel spectral sensor. The sensors are hosted by a light-weight, battery-powered microcomputer. We acquired pilot data from children while they were engaged in various indoor and outdoor activities. RESULTS: The device proved to be comfortable, easy, and safe to wear, and able to collect very useful data on the statistics of illumination and distances. CONCLUSIONS: The designed device is an ideal tool to be used in a population of young children, some of whom will later develop myopia and some of whom will not. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Such data would be critical for determining the properties of the visual environment that put children at risk for becoming myopic.},

   abstract = {Light has many non-visual effects on human physiology, including alterations in sleep, mood, and alertness. These effects are mainly mediated by photoreceptors containing the photopigment melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity to short wavelength ('blue') light. Commercially available light sensors are commonly wrist-worn and report photopic illuminance and are calibrated to perceive visual brightness and hence cannot be used to investigate the non-visual impacts of light. In this paper, we report the development of a wearable spectrophotometer designed to be worn as a pendant or affixed to clothing to capture spectral power density data close to eye level in the visible wavelength range 380-780 nm. From this, the relative impact of a given light stimulus can be determined for each photoreceptive input in the human eye by calculating effective illuminances. This device showed high accuracy for all effective illuminances while measuring a range of commonly encountered light sources by calibrating for directional response, dark noise, sensor saturation, non-linearity, stray-light and spectral response. Features of the device include IoT-integration, onboard data storage and processing, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) enabled data transfer, and cloud storage in one cohesive unit.},

Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard. The recommendations are supported by detailed analysis of the sensitivity of human circadian, neuroendocrine, and alerting responses to ocular light and provide a straightforward framework to inform lighting design and practice.},

   abstract = {Humans live in a 24-hour environment, in which light and darkness follow a diurnal pattern. Our circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus, is entrained to the 24-hour solar day via a pathway from the retina and synchronises our internal biological rhythms. Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external light-dark cycles. While the exact relationship between the availability of artificial light and CRSWD remains to be established, nocturnal light has been shown to alter circadian rhythms and sleep in humans. On the other hand, light can also be used as an effective and noninvasive therapeutic option with little to no side effects, to improve sleep,mood and general well-being. This article reviews our current state of knowledge regarding the effects of light on circadian rhythms, sleep, and mood.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Myopia (short-sightedness) is an emerging WHO priority eye disease. Rise in prevalence and severity are driven by changes in lifestyle and environment of children and young people (CYP), including less time spent in bright daylight and more time spent on near-vision activities. We aimed to systematically map the literature describing direct, objective measurements of the visual environment of CYP. METHODS: We conducted searches in Ovid Medline 1946, Ovid Embase and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in November 2024. We included primary research written in English on environmental/behavioural factors and myopia onset/progression in CYP 3-18 years. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts/full texts. RESULTS: We included 34 articles: 21 explored the association of indoor and/or outdoor light exposure and myopia and included light measurements, two near-vision activities, four both light and near-work, four time outdoors without illuminance measurements, and three light exposure based on meteorological data. Most measurements were carried out at the level of individual children, rather than the surrounding environment alone. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations in measurement techniques, there is evidence that reduced illuminance, less time spent in bright light and increased daily duration/sustained episodes of near-vision activities and reduced working distance are associated with increased myopia prevalence/progression.},

Light also has a more fundamental role in regulating rhythms in physiology and behaviour, as well as in the acute secretion of hormones such as melatonin and changes in alertness, where light exposure at short-time, medium-time and long-time scales has different effects on these visual and non-visual functions. Yet patterns of light exposure in the real world are inherently messy: we move in and out of buildings and are therefore exposed to mixtures of artificial and natural light, and the physical makeup of our environment can also drastically alter the spectral composition and spatial distribution of the emitted light. In spatial vision, the examination of natural image statistics has proven to be an important driver in research. Here, we expand this concept to the spectral domain and develop the concept of the 'spectral diet' of humans.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess light exposure during days with indoor, outdoor, and night work and days off work. METHODS: Light intensity was continuously recorded for 7 days across the year among indoor (n = 170), outdoor (n = 151), and night workers (n = 188) in Denmark (55-56 degrees N) equipped with a personal light recorder. White light intensity, duration above 80, 1000, and 2500 lux, and proportion of red, green, and blue light was depicted by time of the day and season for work days and days off work. RESULTS: Indoor workers' average light exposure only intermittently exceeded 1000 lux during daytime working hours in summer and never in winter. During daytime working hours, most outdoor workers exceeded 2500 lux in summer and 1000 lux in winter. Night workers spent on average 10-50 min >80 lux when working night shifts. During days off work, indoor and night workers were exposed to higher light intensities than during work days and few differences were seen between indoor, outdoor, and night workers. The spectral composition of light was similar for indoor, outdoor, and night workers during days at and off work. CONCLUSION: The night workers of this study were during night hours on average exposed for a limited time to light intensities expected to suppress melatonin. The indoor workers were exposed to light levels during daylight hours that may reduce general well-being and mood, especially in winter. Outdoor workers were during summer daylight hours exposed to light levels comparable to those used for the treatment of depression.},

   abstract = {Shift work causes disruption to circadian physiological processes in the human body, and desynchronization from the natural day-and-night rhythm. Circadian disruption is thought to explain the associations between shift work and various long-term diseases; light is an unrivalled synchronizer (or Zeitgeber) of circadian processes and inappropriate light exposure plausibly plays a critical role in the development of health impairments. As published measurement data on the actual light environments encountered by shift workers are sparse, nurses working in two hospitals in London (UK) and Dortmund (Germany) wore light-logging dosimetry devices to measure personal light exposures continuously over a week in three different seasons. The study identifies and quantifies several of the characteristics of light exposure related to different working patterns in winter, spring, and summer, and quantifies interindividual variations. These data enable informed design of light exposure interventions or changes to shifts to reduce unwanted effects of disruptive light exposure profiles.},

   abstract = {Light is considered the most potent synchronizer of the human circadian system and exerts many other non-image-forming effects, including those that affect brain function. These effects are mediated in part by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin. The spectral sensitivity of melanopsin is greatest for blue light at approximately 480 nm. At present, there is little information on how the spectral composition of light to which people are exposed varies over the 24 h period and across seasons. Twenty-two subjects, aged 22+/-4 yrs (mean+/-SD) participated during the winter months (November-February), and 12 subjects aged 25+/-3 yrs participated during the summer months (April-August). Subjects wore Actiwatch-RGB monitors, as well as Actiwatch-L monitors, for seven consecutive days while living in England. These monitors measured activity and light exposure in the red, green, and blue spectral regions, in addition to broad-spectrum white light, with a 2 min resolution. Light exposure during the day was analyzed for the interval between 09:00 and 21:00 h. The time course of white-light exposure differed significantly between seasons (p = 0.0022), with light exposure increasing in the morning hours and declining in the afternoon hours, and with a more prominent decline in the winter. Overall light exposure was significantly higher in summer than winter (p = 0.0002). Seasonal differences in the relative contribution of blue-light exposure to overall light exposure were also observed (p = 0.0006), in particular during the evening hours. During the summer evenings (17:00-21:00 h), the relative contribution of blue light was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) (40.2+/-1.1%) than during winter evenings (26.6+/-0.9%). The present data show that in addition to overall light exposure, the spectral composition of light exposure varies over the day and with season.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the association between objectively measured ambient light exposure and longitudinal axial length changes (and their seasonal variations) over a period of 12 months in young adults. METHODS: This prospective longitudinal observational study included 43 healthy young adult university students (21 emmetropes and 22 myopes) aged between 18 and 30 years. Three axial length measurements were collected at 6-month intervals (i.e. at baseline, 6 and 12 months), in summer and winter to determine the axial eye growth. Personal ambient light exposure data were measured in winter and summer months with wearable sensors, from which the mean daily time exposed to bright (outdoor) light levels (>1000 lux) was derived. RESULTS: Greater daily bright light exposure was associated with less axial eye growth (beta = -0.002, p = 0.006) over 12 months. In summer, myopes exhibited significantly greater changes in axial length (mean change 0.04 +/- 0.05 mm) compared to emmetropes (-0.01 +/- 0.05 mm) (p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between refractive groups in winter. Emmetropes also spent significantly greater time in outdoor light levels in summer compared to winter (p < 0.0001), while myopes spent similar time outdoors during both seasons (p = 0.12). Differences in light exposure between summer and winter were also associated with seasonal differences in axial eye growth (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: In young adults, greater time spent in bright light was associated with slower longitudinal axial eye growth. Seasonal light exposure and axial length changes were dependent on refractive error in this population and also exhibited an inverse relationship.},

Subjects wore photosensors on their wrists and lapels (or foreheads while in bed) 24 h per day for an average of 5-6 days per quarter. The maximum of the two illumination readings was stored each minute. Annual average time spent per day in outdoor illumination (> or = 1000 lux) was significantly higher in San Diego than it was in Rochester (p < .04). Daily durations of illumination at or exceeding thresholds of 1, 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 lux were highly seasonal in the sample as a whole (p < .01 at 1 lux, p < .0001 at other thresholds). Seasonal variation in outdoor illumination was far more pronounced in Rochester than it was in San Diego (interaction p < .001) but remained significant in San Diego (p < or = .03). Seasonal variation in indoor illumination was generally similar in the two cities. The median Rochester subject experienced illumination > or = 1000 lux for 2 h 23 min per day during summer and 23 min per day during winter. The corresponding times in San Diego were 2 h 10 min and 1 h 20 min. Neither age nor gender predicted illumination duration at any level. Both season and geographic location strongly influenced human illumination exposure, and behavior (choice of indoor vs. outdoor environment) was the most important mediating factor.},

   abstract = {In the absence of electric light, sleep for humans typically starts soon after dusk and at higher latitudes daily sleep timing changes seasonally as photoperiod changes. However, access to electric light shields humans from natural photoperiod changes, and whether seasonal changes in sleep occur despite this isolation from the natural light-dark cycle remains a matter of controversy. We measured sleep timing in over 500 university students living in the city of Seattle, WA (47.6 degrees N) throughout the four seasons; we show that even when students are following a school schedule, sleep timing is delayed during the fall and winter. For instance, during the winter school days, students fell asleep 35 min later and woke up 27 min later (under daylight-savings time) than students during the summer school days, a change that is an hour larger relative to solar midnight. Furthermore, chronotype defined by mid-sleep on free days corrected for oversleep (MSFc), an indirect estimate of circadian phase, was more than 30 min later in the winter compared with the summer. Analysis of the effect of light exposure showed that the number of hours of light exposure to at least 50 lux during the daytime was a stronger predictor of MSFc than the exposure time to this illuminance after dusk. Specifically, MSFc was advanced by 30 min for each additional hour of light exposure during daytime and delayed by only 15 min for each additional hour of postdusk exposure to light. Additionally, the time of the day of exposure to high light intensities was more predictive of MSFc when daytime exposure was considered than when exposure for the full 24-h day was considered. Our results show that although sleep time is highly synchronized to social time, a delayed timing of sleep is evident during the winter months. They also suggest that daily exposure to daylight is key to prevent this delayed phase of the circadian clock and thus circadian disruption that is typically exacerbated in high-latitude winters.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The annual decrease of daylight duration initiates a depressive phase in patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and light therapy treats it. How much bright light exposure in winter and summer these patients actually receive may help understand the pathogenetic factors initiating SAD. METHODS: During a week in winter and summer, women with and without SAD kept daily logs of the time spent outdoors, subjective sleep, and self-ratings of mood and alertness. RESULTS: Compared with the winter depressive state, mood, alertness, and sleep of SAD patients improved in summer to control values, but did not correlate with the amount of light exposure. In summer, patients with SAD spent more time outdoors than controls. LIMITATION: Light logs--in comparison with light monitor measurements--may overestimate light exposure outdoors. CONCLUSION: Women with SAD do not spend less time outdoors in winter than controls, but spend more time outdoors in summer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients with SAD show a high amplitude seasonal difference in outdoor light exposure. The susceptibility to winter depression may arise not from behaviourally-related lack of sufficient light exposure, but an increased vulnerability to the amount of light received. They may require more light than controls to remain euthymic (higher light exposure in summer, light therapy in winter).},

We summarize the neurophysiology of this newly described sensory pathway and consider implications for the measurement, production, and application of light. A new light-measurement strategy taking account of the complex photoreceptive inputs to these non-visual responses is proposed for use by researchers, and simple suggestions for artificial/architectural lighting are provided for regulatory authorities, lighting manufacturers, designers, and engineers.},

From a thorough literature search, we identify ten wearable light meters from human studies on light exposure and myopia and present an overview of their parameters, thereby demonstrating the wide between-device variability and discussing its implications. We further identify 20 publications, including two reanalyses, reporting investigations of light-myopia associations with data from human subjects wearing light meters. We thoroughly review the publications with respect to general characteristics, aspects of data collection, participant population, as well as data analysis and interpretation, and also assess potential patterns regarding the absence or presence of light-myopia associations in their results. In doing so, we highlight areas in which more research is needed as well as several aspects that warrant consideration in the study of light exposure and myopia.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Exposure to light fundamentally influences human physiology and behaviour by synchronising our biological clock to the external light-dark cycle and controlling melatonin production. In addition to well-controlled laboratory studies, more naturalistic approaches to examining these "non-visual" effects of light have been developed in recent years. As naturalistic light exposure is quite unlike well-controlled stimulus conditions in the laboratory, it is critical to measure light exposure in a person-referenced way, the "spectral diet." To this end, light loggers have been developed to capture personalised light exposure. As an alternative to light sensors integrated into wrist-worn actimeters, pendants, or brooch-based light loggers, a recently developed wearable light logger laterally attached to spectacle frames enables the measurement of biologically relevant quantities in the corneal plane. METHODS: Here, we examine the usability and acceptability of using the light logger in an undergraduate student sample (n = 18, mean+/-1SD: 20.1 +/- 1.7 years; 9 female; Oxford, UK) in real-world conditions during a 24-h measurement period. We probed the acceptability of the light logger using rating questionnaires and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Our quantitative results show a modest acceptability of the light logger. A thematic analysis of the open-ended questions reveals that the form factor of the device, in particular, size, weight, and stability, and reactions from other people to the wearer of the light logger, were commonly mentioned aspects. CONCLUSION: In sum, the results indicate the miniaturisation of light loggers and "invisible" integration into extant everyday objects as key areas for future technological development, facilitating the availability of light exposure data for developing personalised intervention strategies in both research, clinical and consumer contexts.},

   abstract = {Understanding user challenges with light dosimeters is crucial for designing more acceptable devices and advancing light exposure research. We systematically evaluated the usability and acceptability of a light dosimeter (lido) with 29 participants who wore the dosimeter near the corneal plane of the eye for 5 days. Common reasons for not wearing the dosimeter included exercise, recharging, wet environments, public places, and discomfort. Despite these issues, participants adhered to using the dosimeter with high compliance (89% of recording time). Our findings revealed a significant discrepancy between mean (300 lx(mEDI)) and median (51 lx(mEDI)) melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance. This discrepancy indicates that the participants were exposed to significantly lower light levels most of the time. Specifically, participants were exposed to light levels above 250 lx(mEDI) for only 14% of their wearing time. This highlights the need for increased exposure to recommended light levels. In the evening, participants were exposed to less than the recommended 10 lx(mEDI) for 58% of their wearing time, which is in line with the guidelines for reducing light exposure before sleep. This study highlights the urgent need for strategies to increase daily light exposure that are more in line with circadian health recommendations.},

   abstract = {This clinical methods comparison study describes the difference between light levels measured at the wrist (Actiwatch-L) and at the eye (Daysimeter) in a postoperative in-patient population. The mean difference between the two devices was less than 10 lux at light levels less than 5000 lux. Agreement between the devices was found to decrease as eye-level light exposure increased. Measurements at eye level of 5000 lux or more corresponded to a difference between the devices of greater than 100 lux. Agreement between the eye- and wrist-level light measurements also appears to be influenced by time of day. During the day, the measurement differences were on average 50 lux higher at eye level, whereas at night they were on average 50 lux lower. Although the wrist-level monitor was found to underestimate light exposure at higher light levels, it was well tolerated by participants in the clinical setting. In contrast, the eye-level monitor was cumbersome and uncomfortable for the patients to wear. This study provides light-exposure data on patients in real conditions in the clinical environment. The results show that wrist-level monitoring provides an adequate estimate of light exposure for in-hospital circadian studies.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate how the mounting location of wearable devices affects the measurement of light intensity. METHODS: Two commercially available wearable devices, HOBO and Clouclip, were used to compare the effects of different mount locations on light intensity measurement. We assessed the consistency of the measurements of the two devices by placing a HOBO and a Clouclip simultaneously in 26 different light environments and measuring the light intensity. To simulate the real-life usage scenarios of the two devices, we had 29 participants wear two HOBOs-one on the wrist and the other on the chest-along with a Clouclip on their spectacles for 1 day; meanwhile, the light intensity was measured and analysed. RESULTS: When under the same light environments, the light intensity measured by the Clouclip was 1.09 times higher than that by the HOBO, with an additional 82.62 units (r(2)=1.00, p<0.001). When simulating the real-life scenarios, the mean light intensity at the eye-level position was significantly lower than that at the chest position (189.13+/-665.78 lux vs 490.75+/-1684.29 lux, p<0.001) and the wrist position (189.13+/-665.78 lux vs 483.87+/-1605.50 lux, p<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in light intensity between the wrist and chest positions (483.87+/-1605.50 lux vs 490.75+/-1684.29 lux, p=1.00). Using a threshold of 1000 lux for outdoor exposure, the estimated light exposure at the eye-level position was significantly lower than that at the chest position (3.9% vs 7.8%, chi(2)=266.14, p<0.001) and the wrist position (3.9% vs 7.7%, chi(2)=254.25, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed significant variations in light exposure among the wrist, chest and eye position. Therefore, caution must be exercised when comparing results obtained from different wearable devices.},

For one week, participants aged 29.2 +/- 5.5 years (n = 25) simultaneously wore a Clouclip, a spectacle-mounted device that records viewing distance and illuminance, and an Actiwatch, a wrist-worn device that measures illuminance and activity. Participants maintained a daily log of activities and completed an activity questionnaire. Objective measures of time outdoors, near (10-< 60 cm) and intermediate (60-100 cm) viewing, and sleep duration were assessed with respect to the daily log and questionnaire. Findings showed that time outdoors per day from the questionnaire (3.2 +/- 0.3 h) was significantly greater than the Clouclip (0.9 +/- 0.8 h) and Actiwatch (0.7 +/- 0.1 h, p < 0.001 for both). Illuminance from the Actiwatch was systematically lower than the Clouclip. Daily near viewing duration was similar between the questionnaire (5.7 +/- 0.6 h) and Clouclip (6.1 +/- 0.4 h, p = 0.76), while duration of intermediate viewing was significantly different between methods (p < 0.001). In conclusion, self-reported time outdoors and viewing behaviors were different than objective measures. The Actiwatch and Clouclip are valuable tools for studying temporal patterns of behavioral factors such as near work, light exposure, and sleep.},

However, monitoring of light exposure is not included in current wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and only recently have international standards defined [Formula: see text] -optic equivalent daylight illuminance (EDI) measures for how the eye responds to light. This article reports a wearable light sensor node that can be incorporated into the IoT to provide monitoring of EDI exposure in real-world settings. We present the system design, electronic performance testing, and accuracy of EDI measurements when compared to a calibrated spectral source. This includes consideration of the directional response of the sensor, and a comparison of performance when placed on different parts of the body, and a demonstration of practical use over 7 days. Our device operates for 3.5 days between charges, with a sampling period of 30 s. It has 10 channels of measurement, over the range 415-910 nm, balancing accuracy and cost considerations. Measured [Formula: see text]-opic EDI results for 13 devices show a mean absolute error of less than 0.07 log lx, and a minimum between device correlation of 0.99. These findings demonstrate that accurate light sensing is feasible, including at wrist worn locations. We provide an experimental platform for use in future investigations in real-world light exposure monitoring and IoT-based lighting control.},

The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge concerning the extent and nature of psychological measurement affecting people who complete the measures. Other aims are to describe how this may affect conclusions drawn in health psychology research and to outline where more research is needed. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Several studies, using a variety of methods, have found measurement procedures to alter subsequent cognition, emotion, and behaviour. In many instances, the effects obtained were of up to medium size. However, the extent to which such studies are representative is not clear: do other studies which find no reactive effects of measurement not exist or do they exist but are not reported? CONCLUSIONS: Although measurement reactivity can yield medium-sized effects, our understanding of this phenomenon is still rudimentary. We do not know the precise circumstances that are likely to result in measurement reactivity: we cannot predict when problems are more likely to arise. There is a particular absence of studies of the mechanisms by which measurement reactivity arises. There is a need for a systematic review of this literature, which should aim to quantify the extent of measurement reactivity effects and to provide a firmer evidence base for theorizing about the sources of reactivity.},

    abstract = { Measuring and analyzing personal light exposure has become increasingly important in circadian and myopia research. Very small measurement values in light exposure patterns, especially zero, are regularly recorded in field studies. These zero-lux values are problematic for commonly applied logarithmic transformations and should neither be dismissed nor be unduly influential in visualizations and statistical modeling. We compare 4 ways to visualize such data on a linear, logarithmic, hybrid, or symlog scale, and we model the light exposure patterns with a generalized additive model by removing zero-lux values, adding a very small or −1 log10 lux value to the dataset, or using the Tweedie error distribution. We show that a symlog-transformed visualization, implemented in LightLogR, displays relevant features of light exposure across scales, including zero-lux, while reducing the emphasis on the small values (<1 lux). Symlog is well-suited to visualize differences in light exposure covering heavy-tailed negative values. We further show that small but not negligible value additions to the light exposure data of −1 log10 lux for statistical modeling allow for acceptable models on a logarithmic scale, while very small values distort results. We also demonstrate the utility of the Tweedie distribution, which does not require prior transformations, models data on a logarithmic scale, and includes zero-lux values, capturing personal light exposure patterns satisfactorily. Data from field studies of personal light exposure require appropriate handling of zero-lux values in a logarithmic context. Symlog scales for visualizations and an appropriate addition to input values for modeling, or the Tweedie distribution, provide a solid basis. Beyond light exposure, other time-series data relevant to biological rhythms, such as accelerometry for ambulatory sleep scoring in humans or wheel-running in animal models, exhibit zero inflation and can benefit from the methods introduced here. }

	abstract = {In field studies using wearable light loggers, participants often need to remove the devices, resulting in non-wear intervals of varying and unknown duration. Accurate detection of these intervals is an essential step in data pre-processing pipelines. However, the limited reporting on whether and how non-wear information is collected and detected has hindered the development of effective data pre-processing strategies and automated detection algorithms. Here, we deploy a multi-modal approach to collect non-wear time during a longitudinal light exposure campaign and systematically compare non-wear detection strategies. Healthy participants (n=26; mean age 28{\textpm}5 years, 14F) wore a near-corneal plane light logger for one week and reported non-wear events in three ways: pressing an {\textquotedblleft}event marker{\textquotedblright} button on the light logger, placing it in a black bag, and using an app-based Wear log. Wear log entries were checked twice a day to ensure high data quality and used as ground truth for non-wear interval detection. Participants showed high adherence to the protocol, with non-wear time constituting 5.4{\textpm}3.8\% (mean{\textpm}SD) of total participation time. Considering button presses, our results indicated that extending time windows beyond one minute improved their detection at the start and end of non-wear intervals, achieving identification in \&gt;85.4\% of cases. To detect non-wear intervals based on black bag use, we applied an algorithm detecting clusters of low illuminance to our data and compared its performance to detecting clusters of low activity. Performance was higher for illuminance (F1=0.76) than activity (F1=0.52). Transition states between wear and non-wear emerged as a major source of misclassification, and we suggest that combining illuminance and activity data could enhance detection accuracy. Lastly, we compared light exposure metrics averaged across the week derived from three datasets: the full dataset, a dataset filtered for non-wear based on self-reports, and a dataset filtered for non-wear using the low illuminance clusters detection algorithm. The differences in light exposure metrics across these datasets were minimal. Our results highlight that while non-wear detection may be less critical in high-compliance cohorts, systematically collecting and detecting non-wear intervals is both feasible and important for ensuring robust data pre-processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
