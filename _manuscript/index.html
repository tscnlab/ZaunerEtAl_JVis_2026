<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Exposure to the optical environment — often referred to as *visual experience* — profoundly influences human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. In controlled laboratory settings, stimuli can be held constant or manipulated parametrically. However, such exposures rarely replicate real-world conditions, which are inherently complex and dynamic, generating high-dimensional datasets that demand rigorous and flexible analysis strategies. This tutorial presents an analysis pipeline for visual experience datasets, with a focus on reproducible workflows for human chronobiology and myopia research. Light exposure and its retinal encoding affect human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. Here we provide step-by-step instructions for importing, visualizing, and processing viewing distance and light exposure data. This includes time-series analyses for working distance, biologically relevant light metrics, and spectral characteristics. The tasks are standardized through the open-source R package [**LightLogR**](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/). By leveraging a modular approach, the tutorial supports researchers in building flexible and robust pipelines that accommodate diverse experimental paradigms and measurement systems.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Validation of the clouclip and utility in measuring viewing distance in adults;,citation_abstract=Abstract Purpose To validate the Clouclip, a continuously measuring objective rangefinder, and examine viewing behaviours during various near tasks in non-myopic and myopic adults. Methods In experiment 1, five Clouclip devices were utilised. An infrared camera was used to visualise and measure infrared beam size and angle. Repeatability for distance tracking was assessed from 5 to 120 cm in 5 cm increments. Accuracy of distance tracking was investigated for paper and iPad targets, spatial integration was calculated, effects of target tilt were determined and light measurements were compared to a lux meter. In experiment 2, viewing behaviour was assessed in 41 subjects (21 non-myopic, 20 myopic) during four 15-min near tasks; (1) passive reading of printed material, (2) active writing on printed material, (3) passive viewing on an electronic device and (4) active engagement on an electronic device. Working distance was compared between tasks and refractive error groups. Results Clouclip distance tracking showed good repeatability, with a mean difference of 0.34 cm and limits of agreement of ±2.0 cm. Clouclip-measured and actual distances were highly correlated for paper and electronic targets from 5 to 120 cm, with mean differences and limits of agreement of 3.96 ± 13.78 cm and 4.48 ± 8.92 cm, respectively; variability increased for distances &amp;amp;amp;gt;100 cm. Tracking ability increased with larger target sizes; tracking was accurate when the target occupied 1.5%–20.3% of tracking beam area, depending on distance and with target tilt up to ±60 degrees. Clouclip- and lux meter-measured ambient illumination were highly correlated for a wide range of intensities (r = 0.96, p &amp;lt; 0.001), but with greater variability for intensities &amp;gt;20 000 lux. The Clouclip infrared beam was measured to have a diameter of 25.6 ± 2.2° and a downward angle of 10.3 ± 0.5°. For subject testing, viewing distance was significantly closer for active and passive printed tasks (29.5 ± 6.7 cm and 33.2 ± 8.8 cm, respectively) than for active and passive electronic tasks (35.4 ± 8.0 cm and 40.8 ± 10.4 cm, respectively), with no differences between refractive error groups (p = 0.88). Conclusions The Clouclip performed well in measuring near and intermediate distances and could distinguish between indoor (&amp;lt;1000 lux) and outdoor (>1000 lux) illumination. A closer working distance was observed for printed tasks compared to those on an iPad, with no difference in viewing distance between non-myopic and myopic adults.;,citation_author=Khob R Bhandari;,citation_author=Lisa A Ostrin;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/opo.12735;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=https://doi.org/10.1111/opo.12735;,citation_volume=40;,citation_journal_title=Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An objective comparison of light intensity and near-visual tasks between rural and urban school children in china by a wearable device clouclip;,citation_abstract=To compare light intensity and near-visual tasks objectively between rural and urban children. Clouclip, a wearable device, was applied to assess metrics of these two factors in 78 fifth-grade students from an urban and from a rural school. The light intensity experienced by urban students was found significantly lower both in the school period (614.05 ± 178.77 vs. 918.41 ± 257.81 lux, P &amp;amp;amp;lt; 0.001) and on the weekend (444.53 ± 216.65 vs. 882.21 ± 536.67 lux, P &amp;lt; 0.001). The duration of exposure to bright light (&amp;gt;1000 lux) was also substantially shorter for urban students. Although no significant difference was found in near work–related behaviors during the school period and the weekend, for the after-school period the urban students had a shorter average viewing distance (30.94 ± 4.14 vs. 34.81 ± 3.93 cm, P &amp;lt; 0.001), a longer accumulated duration of near work (2.25 ± 0.53 vs. 1.95 ± 0.46 hours, P = 0.010), a greater time ratio of near work (56% ± 14% vs. 49% ± 14%, P = 0.045), and a greater time ratio of excessively close near work (49% ± 13% vs. 40% ± 12%, P = 0.001). Our data indicate there were substantial differences in light exposure and near-work metrics between the two regions. The correlation between these differences and the discrepancy in regional myopia prevalence needs further investigation. The objective quantification of these metrics might help explain the varied myopia prevalence among regions.;,citation_author=Longbo Wen;,citation_author=Qian Cheng;,citation_author=Weizhong Lan;,citation_author=Yingpin Cao;,citation_author=Xiaoning Li;,citation_author=Yiqiu Lu;,citation_author=Zhenghua Lin;,citation_author=Lun Pan;,citation_author=Haogang Zhu;,citation_author=Zhikuan Yang;,citation_publication_date=2019-11;,citation_cover_date=2019-11;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1167/tvst.8.6.15;,citation_issue=6;,citation_doi=10.1167/tvst.8.6.15;,citation_issn=2164-2591;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Translational Vision Science &amp;amp; Technology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Objectively measured near work, outdoor exposure and myopia in children;,citation_abstract=Aim To reassess the association between near work, outdoor exposure and myopia in children through an objective approach.Methods Eighty-six children (10.130.48 years) were asked to wear Clouclip, a newly developed wearable device that is able to measure working distance and eye-level illuminance, for a complete week to obtain information on near work and outdoor exposure. The mean daily Clouclip wearing time was 11.721.14 hour. The spherical equivalent refraction was determined by cycloplegic autorefraction.Results The myopic children were found to be exposed to light intensities &amp;amp;amp;gt;3000 lux (0.680.50 hour vs 1.020.53 hour, p=0.012) and &amp;gt;5000 lux (0.420.35 hour vs 0.630.31 hour, p=0.004) for shorter durations on average each day than the non-myopic children. Additionally, the myopic children spent more time on average each day on activities at a distance of &amp;lt;20 cm than non-myopic children (1.890.61 hour vs 1.520.77 hour, p=0.019). In the multivariate logistic analysis, the time spent with a higher light intensity (&amp;gt;3000 lux (OR=0.27, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.72, p=0.009); &amp;gt;5000 lux (OR=0.11, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.56, p=0.008)) and a working distance of &amp;lt;20 cm (in a circumstance of &amp;gt;3000 lux (OR=1.17, 95% CI: 1.09 to 1.86, p=0.038) or in that of &amp;gt;5000 lux (OR=1.12, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.77, p=0.046)) were the independent protective factors and risk factors, respectively.Conclusion The current study provides novel evidence, based on objective data, to support the association between the intensity of near work, light intensity and myopia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Power analysis for personal light exposure measurements and interventions;,citation_abstract=Background Light exposure regulates the human circadian system and more widely affects health, well-being, and performance. With the rise in field studies on light exposure’s effects, the amount of data collected through wearable loggers and dosimeters has also grown. These data are more complex than stationary laboratory measurements. Determining sample sizes in field studies is challenging, as the literature shows a wide range of sample sizes (between 2 and 1,887 from a recent review of the field and approaching 105 participants in first studies using large-scale “biobank” databases). Current decisions on sample size for light exposure data collection lack a specific basis rooted in power analysis. Therefore, there is a need for clear guidance on selecting sample sizes. Methods Here, we introduce a novel procedure based on hierarchical bootstrapping for calculating statistical power and required sample size for wearable light and optical radiation logging data and derived summary metrics, taking into account the hierarchical data structure (mixed-effects model) through stepwise resampling. Alongside this method, we publish a dataset that serves as one possible basis to perform these calculations: one week of continuous data in winter and summer, respectively, for 13 early-day shift-work participants (collected in Dortmund, Germany; lat. 51.514° N, lon. 7.468° E). Results Applying our method on the dataset for twelve different summary metrics (luminous exposure, geometric mean, and standard deviation, timing/time above/below threshold, mean/midpoint of darkest/brightest hours, intradaily variability) with a target comparison across winter and summer, reveals required sample sizes ranging from as few as 3 to more than 50. About half of the metrics–those that focus on the bright time of day–showed sufficient power already with the smallest sample. In contrast, metrics centered around the dark time of the day and daily patterns required higher sample sizes: mean timing of light below mel EDI of 10 lux (5), intradaily variability (17), mean of darkest 5 hours (24), and mean timing of light above mel EDI of 250 lux (45). The geometric standard deviation and the midpoint of the darkest 5 hours lacked sufficient power within the tested sample size. Conclusions Our novel method provides an effective technique for estimating sample size in light exposure studies. It is specific to the used light exposure or dosimetry metric and the effect size inherent in the light exposure data at the basis of the bootstrap. Notably, the method goes beyond typical implementations of bootstrapping to appropriately address the structure of the data. It can be applied to other datasets, enabling comparisons across scenarios beyond seasonal differences and activity patterns. With an ever-growing pool of data from the emerging literature, the utility of this method will increase and provide a solid statistical basis for the selection of sample sizes.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A novel wearable sensor for objective measurement of distance and illumination;,citation_abstract=Abstract Purpose To evaluate the rangefinding and light sensing capabilities of a novel wearable sensor, the Visual Environment Evaluation Tool (VEET) developed for myopia research. Methods The VEET 1.0 (Meta, LLC) is a temple-integrated system mounted on a spectacle frame. Both the left and right temples house four sensors each, angled straight ahead and 20° downward/4° nasal, respectively. For validation, VEET-mounted spectacles were placed on a mannequin head. An infrared camera was used to capture the spatial characteristics of the rangefinding beam. Distance measurements were collected against a wall for 5–400 cm. The accuracy of distance measurements for different target types, sizes and tilt was assessed. Ambient illumination was captured in different indoor and outdoor settings and compared to a lux meter. Results All devices (N = 20) were capable of capturing distances for the full range evaluated, 5–400 cm, against a wall. There was a strong relationship between the actual and measured distances, with a slope of 1.01 ± 0.003 and 0.95 ± 0.007, for the left and right temples, respectively. Distance measurements were repeatable across different target types, including paper and tablet. Mean beam diameter of five tested devices was 52.2° ± 7.5°. The VEET effectively measured distances across different target sizes, ranging from 2 × 2 cm and larger and target tilt ±60°. Illumination measurements across different indoor and outdoor settings demonstrated a strong linear relationship with lux meter readings (R2 = 0.99 and 0.78 for the left and right temples, respectively), effectively distinguishing indoor (&amp;amp;amp;lt;1000 lux) and outdoor (≥1000 lux) illumination levels. Conclusion The VEET provides accurate quantification of real-time distances across different target types and sizes and is capable of effectively distinguishing indoor and outdoor illumination levels. The VEET will be valuable in studies evaluating risk factors for myopia to gain a better understanding of the role of near work and light exposure.;,citation_author=Raman Prasad Sah;,citation_author=Pavan Kalyan Narra;,citation_author=Lisa A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The clouclip, a wearable device for measuring near-work and outdoor time: Validation and comparison of objective measures with questionnaire estimates;,citation_abstract=Abstract Purpose To validate a novel wearable device that can measure both viewing distance and light exposure, Clouclip, and compare questionnaire estimates regarding near-work and outdoor time with the objective measures obtained using Clouclip. Methods Fifteen Clouclips were selected to measure different distances and levels of illuminance. With each Clouclip, five measurements at different distances and light intensities were measured and recorded. Eighty participants wore Clouclips for a week and completed an activity questionnaire afterwards. Results The intra- and inter-Clouclip coefficients were 1.00 and 0.99 for measuring distance and 1.00 and 1.00 for illuminance, respectively. Within the measurement limit, the maximum relative error was 2.07% for distance and 2.23% for illuminance. Assuming that &amp;amp;amp;lt;30&nbsp;cm was the typical distance for near-work activities and &amp;gt;1000 Lux was the typical cut-off for outdoor environments, the questionnaire showed a trend of overestimation for both. The greatest overestimation of near-work occurred during the school period [Questionnaire: 4.73&nbsp;hr (4.73, 5.07) versus Clouclip: 2.16&nbsp;hr (1.74, 2.78); p&nbsp;&amp;lt;&nbsp;0.01]. The greatest overestimation of outdoor activity also occurred during the school period [Questionnaire: 1.60&nbsp;hr (1.33, 1.85) versus Clouclip: 1.21&nbsp;hr (0.96, 1.50); p&nbsp;<&nbsp;0.01]. Based on Clouclip, the total time spent outdoors was estimated to be 1.55&nbsp;hr on school days, of which 0.34&nbsp;hr occurred after school. For weekend days, however, the duration was only 0.17&nbsp;hr. Conclusions Clouclip had excellent precision and accuracy. Although the agreement between the questionnaire and Clouclip was relatively poor, they were able to complement each other to provide a more logical and feasible assessment of exposure to near-work and outdoor activity.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Protocol for a prospective, multicentre, cross-sectional cohort study to assess personal light exposure;,citation_abstract=Light profoundly impacts many aspects of human physiology and behaviour, including the synchronization of the circadian clock, the production of melatonin, and cognition. These effects of light, termed the non-visual effects of light, have been primarily investigated in laboratory settings, where light intensity, spectrum and timing can be carefully controlled to draw associations with physiological outcomes of interest. Recently, the increasing availability of wearable light loggers has opened the possibility of studying personal light exposure in free-living conditions where people engage in activities of daily living, yielding findings associating aspects of light exposure and health outcomes, supporting the importance of adequate light exposure at appropriate times for human health. However, comprehensive protocols capturing environmental (e.g., geographical location, season, climate, photoperiod) and individual factors (e.g., culture, personal habits, behaviour, commute type, profession) contributing to the measured light exposure are currently lacking. Here, we present a protocol that combines smartphone-based experience sampling (experience sampling implementing Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS ratings) and high-quality light exposure data collection at three body sites (near-corneal plane between the two eyes mounted on spectacle, neck-worn pendant/badge, and wrist-worn watch-like design) to capture daily factors related to individuals’ light exposure. We will implement the protocol in an international multi-centre study to investigate the environmental and socio-cultural factors influencing light exposure patterns in Germany, Ghana, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Turkey (minimum n = 15, target n = 30 per site, minimum n = 90, target n = 180 across all sites). With the resulting dataset, lifestyle and context-specific factors that contribute to healthy light exposure will be identified. This information is essential in designing effective public health interventions.;,citation_author=C. Guidolin;,citation_author=S. Aerts;,citation_author=G. K. Agbeshie;,citation_author=K. O.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Metadata recommendations for light logging and dosimetry datasets;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Light exposure significantly impacts human health, regulating our circadian clock, sleep-wake cycle and other physiological processes. With the emergence of wearable light loggers and dosimeters, research on real-world light exposure effects is growing. There is a critical need to standardize data collection and documentation across studies. RESULTS: This article proposes a new metadata descriptor designed to capture crucial information within personalized light exposure datasets collected with wearable light loggers and dosimeters. The descriptor, developed collaboratively by international experts, has a modular structure for future expansion and customization. It covers four key domains: study design, participant characteristics, dataset details, and device specifications. Each domain includes specific metadata fields for comprehensive documentation. The user-friendly descriptor is available in JSON format. A web interface simplifies generating compliant JSON files for broad accessibility. Version control allows for future improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Our metadata descriptor empowers researchers to enhance the quality and value of their light dosimetry datasets by making them FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Verification, analytical validation and clinical validation (V3) of wearable dosimeters and light loggers;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Light exposure is an important driver and modulator of human physiology, behavior and overall health, including the biological clock, sleep-wake cycles, mood and alertness. Light can also be used as a directed intervention, e.g., in the form of light therapy in seasonal affective disorder (SAD), jetlag prevention and treatment, or to treat circadian disorders. Recently, a system of quantities and units related to the physiological effects of light was standardized by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE S 026/E:2018). At the same time, biometric monitoring technologies (BioMeTs) to capture personalized light exposure were developed. However, because there are currently no standard approaches to evaluate the digital dosimeters, the need to provide a firm framework for the characterization, calibration, and reporting for these digital sensors is urgent. OBJECTIVE: This article provides such a framework by applying the principles of verification, analytic validation and clinical validation (V3) as a state-of-the-art approach for tools and standards in digital medicine to light dosimetry. RESULTS: This article describes opportunities for the use of digital dosimeters for basic research, for monitoring light exposure, and for measuring adherence in both clinical and non-clinical populations to light-based interventions in clinical trials.;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=LightLogR: Reproducible analysis of personal light exposure data;,citation_abstract=Light plays an important role in human health and well-being, which necessitates the study of the effects of personal light exposure in real-world settings, measured by means of wearable devices. A growing number of studies incorporate these kinds of data to assess associations between light and health outcomes. Yet with few or missing standards, guidelines, and frameworks, it is challenging setting up measurements, analysing the data, and comparing outcomes between studies. Overall, time series data from wearable light loggers are significantly more complex compared to controlled stimuli used in laboratory studies. In this paper, we introduce LightLogR, a novel resource to facilitate these research efforts. The package for R statistical software is open-source and permissively MIT-licenced. As part of a developing software ecosystem, LightLogR is built with common challenges of current and future datasets in mind. The package standardises many tasks for importing and processing personal light exposure data. It allows for quick as well as detailed insights into the datasets through summary and visualisation tools. Furthermore, LightLogR incorporates major metrics commonly used in the field (61 metrics across 17 metric families), all while embracing an inherently hierarchical, participant-based data structure.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A child-friendly wearable device for quantifying environmental risk factors for myopia;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: In the past few decades, the prevalence of myopia, where the eye grows too long, has increased dramatically. The visual environment appears to be critical to regulating the eye growth. Thus, it is very important to determine the properties of the environment that put children at risk for myopia. Researchers have suggested that the intensity of illumination and range of distances to which a child’s eyes are exposed are important, but this has not been confirmed. METHODS: We designed, built, and tested an inexpensive, child-friendly, head-mounted device that can measure the intensity and spectral content of illumination approaching the eyes and can also measure the distances to which the central visual field of the eyes are exposed. The device is mounted on a child’s bicycle helmet. It includes a camera that measures distances over a substantial range and a six-channel spectral sensor. The sensors are hosted by a light-weight, battery-powered microcomputer. We acquired pilot data from children while they were engaged in various indoor and outdoor activities. RESULTS: The device proved to be comfortable, easy, and safe to wear, and able to collect very useful data on the statistics of illumination and distances. CONCLUSIONS: The designed device is an ideal tool to be used in a population of young children, some of whom will later develop myopia and some of whom will not.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Wearable light spectral sensor optimized for measuring daily alpha-opic light exposure;,citation_abstract=Light has many non-visual effects on human physiology, including alterations in sleep, mood, and alertness. These effects are mainly mediated by photoreceptors containing the photopigment melanopsin, which has a peak sensitivity to short wavelength (’blue’) light. Commercially available light sensors are commonly wrist-worn and report photopic illuminance and are calibrated to perceive visual brightness and hence cannot be used to investigate the non-visual impacts of light. In this paper, we report the development of a wearable spectrophotometer designed to be worn as a pendant or affixed to clothing to capture spectral power density data close to eye level in the visible wavelength range 380-780 nm. From this, the relative impact of a given light stimulus can be determined for each photoreceptive input in the human eye by calculating effective illuminances. This device showed high accuracy for all effective illuminances while measuring a range of commonly encountered light sources by calibrating for directional response, dark noise, sensor saturation, non-linearity, stray-light and spectral response.

Prevailing patterns of light exposure do not optimally engage these actions for many individuals, but advances in our understanding of the underpinning mechanisms and emerging lighting technologies now present opportunities to adjust lighting to promote optimal physical and mental health and performance. A newly developed, international standard provides a SI-compliant way of quantifying the influence of light on the intrinsically photosensitive, melanopsin-expressing, retinal neurons that mediate these effects. The present report provides recommendations for lighting, based on an expert scientific consensus and expressed in an easily measured quantity (melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melaponic EDI)) defined within this standard.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of light on human circadian rhythms, sleep and mood;,citation_abstract=Humans live in a 24-hour environment, in which light and darkness follow a diurnal pattern. Our circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in the hypothalamus, is entrained to the 24-hour solar day via a pathway from the retina and synchronises our internal biological rhythms. Rhythmic variations in ambient illumination impact behaviours such as rest during sleep and activity during wakefulness as well as their underlying biological processes. Rather recently, the availability of artificial light has substantially changed the light environment, especially during evening and night hours. This may increase the risk of developing circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD), which are often caused by a misalignment of endogenous circadian rhythms and external light-dark cycles. While the exact relationship between the availability of artificial light and CRSWD remains to be established, nocturnal light has been shown to alter circadian rhythms and sleep in humans. On the other hand, light can also be used as an effective and noninvasive therapeutic option with little to no side effects, to improve sleep,mood and general well-being.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring the visual environment of children and young people at risk of myopia: A scoping review;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: Myopia (short-sightedness) is an emerging WHO priority eye disease. Rise in prevalence and severity are driven by changes in lifestyle and environment of children and young people (CYP), including less time spent in bright daylight and more time spent on near-vision activities. We aimed to systematically map the literature describing direct, objective measurements of the visual environment of CYP. METHODS: We conducted searches in Ovid Medline 1946, Ovid Embase and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in November 2024. We included primary research written in English on environmental/behavioural factors and myopia onset/progression in CYP 3-18 years. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts/full texts. RESULTS: We included 34 articles: 21 explored the association of indoor and/or outdoor light exposure and myopia and included light measurements, two near-vision activities, four both light and near-work, four time outdoors without illuminance measurements, and three light exposure based on meteorological data. Most measurements were carried out at the level of individual children, rather than the surrounding environment alone. CONCLUSION: Despite limitations in measurement techniques, there is evidence that reduced illuminance, less time spent in bright light and increased daily duration/sustained episodes of near-vision activities and reduced working distance are associated with increased myopia prevalence/progression.;,citation_author=A.

Light also has a more fundamental role in regulating rhythms in physiology and behaviour, as well as in the acute secretion of hormones such as melatonin and changes in alertness, where light exposure at short-time, medium-time and long-time scales has different effects on these visual and non-visual functions. Yet patterns of light exposure in the real world are inherently messy: we move in and out of buildings and are therefore exposed to mixtures of artificial and natural light, and the physical makeup of our environment can also drastically alter the spectral composition and spatial distribution of the emitted light. In spatial vision, the examination of natural image statistics has proven to be an important driver in research.

METHODS: Light intensity was continuously recorded for 7 days across the year among indoor (n = 170), outdoor (n = 151), and night workers (n = 188) in Denmark (55-56 degrees N) equipped with a personal light recorder. White light intensity, duration above 80, 1000, and 2500 lux, and proportion of red, green, and blue light was depicted by time of the day and season for work days and days off work. RESULTS: Indoor workers’ average light exposure only intermittently exceeded 1000 lux during daytime working hours in summer and never in winter. During daytime working hours, most outdoor workers exceeded 2500 lux in summer and 1000 lux in winter. Night workers spent on average 10-50 min &amp;amp;amp;gt;80 lux when working night shifts. During days off work, indoor and night workers were exposed to higher light intensities than during work days and few differences were seen between indoor, outdoor, and night workers. The spectral composition of light was similar for indoor, outdoor, and night workers during days at and off work. CONCLUSION: The night workers of this study were during night hours on average exposed for a limited time to light intensities expected to suppress melatonin. The indoor workers were exposed to light levels during daylight hours that may reduce general well-being and mood, especially in winter.

Circadian disruption is thought to explain the associations between shift work and various long-term diseases; light is an unrivalled synchronizer (or Zeitgeber) of circadian processes and inappropriate light exposure plausibly plays a critical role in the development of health impairments. As published measurement data on the actual light environments encountered by shift workers are sparse, nurses working in two hospitals in London (UK) and Dortmund (Germany) wore light-logging dosimetry devices to measure personal light exposures continuously over a week in three different seasons. The study identifies and quantifies several of the characteristics of light exposure related to different working patterns in winter, spring, and summer, and quantifies interindividual variations. These data enable informed design of light exposure interventions or changes to shifts to reduce unwanted effects of disruptive light exposure profiles.;,citation_author=L. L. A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Daily and seasonal variation in the spectral composition of light exposure in humans;,citation_abstract=Light is considered the most potent synchronizer of the human circadian system and exerts many other non-image-forming effects, including those that affect brain function. These effects are mediated in part by intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells that express the photopigment melanopsin. The spectral sensitivity of melanopsin is greatest for blue light at approximately 480 nm. At present, there is little information on how the spectral composition of light to which people are exposed varies over the 24 h period and across seasons. Twenty-two subjects, aged 22+/-4 yrs (mean+/-SD) participated during the winter months (November-February), and 12 subjects aged 25+/-3 yrs participated during the summer months (April-August). Subjects wore Actiwatch-RGB monitors, as well as Actiwatch-L monitors, for seven consecutive days while living in England. These monitors measured activity and light exposure in the red, green, and blue spectral regions, in addition to broad-spectrum white light, with a 2 min resolution. Light exposure during the day was analyzed for the interval between 09:00 and 21:00 h. The time course of white-light exposure differed significantly between seasons (p = 0.0022), with light exposure increasing in the morning hours and declining in the afternoon hours, and with a more prominent decline in the winter. Overall light exposure was significantly higher in summer than winter (p = 0.0002). Seasonal differences in the relative contribution of blue-light exposure to overall light exposure were also observed (p = 0.0006), in particular during the evening hours.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Influence of seasons upon personal light exposure and longitudinal axial length changes in young adults;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: To investigate the association between objectively measured ambient light exposure and longitudinal axial length changes (and their seasonal variations) over a period of 12 months in young adults. METHODS: This prospective longitudinal observational study included 43 healthy young adult university students (21 emmetropes and 22 myopes) aged between 18 and 30 years. Three axial length measurements were collected at 6-month intervals (i.e. at baseline, 6 and 12 months), in summer and winter to determine the axial eye growth. Personal ambient light exposure data were measured in winter and summer months with wearable sensors, from which the mean daily time exposed to bright (outdoor) light levels (&amp;amp;amp;gt;1000 lux) was derived. RESULTS: Greater daily bright light exposure was associated with less axial eye growth (beta = -0.002, p = 0.006) over 12 months. In summer, myopes exhibited significantly greater changes in axial length (mean change 0.04 +/- 0.05 mm) compared to emmetropes (-0.01 +/- 0.05 mm) (p = 0.001), but there was no significant difference between refractive groups in winter. Emmetropes also spent significantly greater time in outdoor light levels in summer compared to winter (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), while myopes spent similar time outdoors during both seasons (p = 0.12). Differences in light exposure between summer and winter were also associated with seasonal differences in axial eye growth (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: In young adults, greater time spent in bright light was associated with slower longitudinal axial eye growth. Seasonal light exposure and axial length changes were dependent on refractive error in this population and also exhibited an inverse relationship.;,citation_author=S. Ulaganathan;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Daytime light exposure is a strong predictor of seasonal variation in sleep and circadian timing of university students;,citation_abstract=In the absence of electric light, sleep for humans typically starts soon after dusk and at higher latitudes daily sleep timing changes seasonally as photoperiod changes. However, access to electric light shields humans from natural photoperiod changes, and whether seasonal changes in sleep occur despite this isolation from the natural light-dark cycle remains a matter of controversy. We measured sleep timing in over 500 university students living in the city of Seattle, WA (47.6 degrees N) throughout the four seasons; we show that even when students are following a school schedule, sleep timing is delayed during the fall and winter. For instance, during the winter school days, students fell asleep 35 min later and woke up 27 min later (under daylight-savings time) than students during the summer school days, a change that is an hour larger relative to solar midnight. Furthermore, chronotype defined by mid-sleep on free days corrected for oversleep (MSFc), an indirect estimate of circadian phase, was more than 30 min later in the winter compared with the summer. Analysis of the effect of light exposure showed that the number of hours of light exposure to at least 50 lux during the daytime was a stronger predictor of MSFc than the exposure time to this illuminance after dusk. Specifically, MSFc was advanced by 30 min for each additional hour of light exposure during daytime and delayed by only 15 min for each additional hour of postdusk exposure to light. Additionally, the time of the day of exposure to high light intensities was more predictive of MSFc when daytime exposure was considered than when exposure for the full 24-h day was considered. Our results show that although sleep time is highly synchronized to social time, a delayed timing of sleep is evident during the winter months. They also suggest that daily exposure to daylight is key to prevent this delayed phase of the circadian clock and thus circadian disruption that is typically exacerbated in high-latitude winters.;,citation_author=G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Winter and summer outdoor light exposure in women with and without seasonal affective disorder;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: The annual decrease of daylight duration initiates a depressive phase in patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD), and light therapy treats it. How much bright light exposure in winter and summer these patients actually receive may help understand the pathogenetic factors initiating SAD. METHODS: During a week in winter and summer, women with and without SAD kept daily logs of the time spent outdoors, subjective sleep, and self-ratings of mood and alertness. RESULTS: Compared with the winter depressive state, mood, alertness, and sleep of SAD patients improved in summer to control values, but did not correlate with the amount of light exposure. In summer, patients with SAD spent more time outdoors than controls. LIMITATION: Light logs–in comparison with light monitor measurements–may overestimate light exposure outdoors. CONCLUSION: Women with SAD do not spend less time outdoors in winter than controls, but spend more time outdoors in summer. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Patients with SAD show a high amplitude seasonal difference in outdoor light exposure. The susceptibility to winter depression may arise not from behaviourally-related lack of sufficient light exposure, but an increased vulnerability to the amount of light received. They may require more light than controls to remain euthymic (higher light exposure in summer, light therapy in winter).;,citation_author=P. Graw;,citation_author=S. Recker;,citation_author=L.

In addition to well-controlled laboratory studies, more naturalistic approaches to examining these &amp;amp;amp;quot;non-visual&amp;quot; effects of light have been developed in recent years. As naturalistic light exposure is quite unlike well-controlled stimulus conditions in the laboratory, it is critical to measure light exposure in a person-referenced way, the &quot;spectral diet.&quot; To this end, light loggers have been developed to capture personalised light exposure. As an alternative to light sensors integrated into wrist-worn actimeters, pendants, or brooch-based light loggers, a recently developed wearable light logger laterally attached to spectacle frames enables the measurement of biologically relevant quantities in the corneal plane. METHODS: Here, we examine the usability and acceptability of using the light logger in an undergraduate student sample (n = 18, mean+/-1SD: 20.1 +/- 1.7 years; 9 female; Oxford, UK) in real-world conditions during a 24-h measurement period. We probed the acceptability of the light logger using rating questionnaires and open-ended questions. RESULTS: Our quantitative results show a modest acceptability of the light logger. A thematic analysis of the open-ended questions reveals that the form factor of the device, in particular, size, weight, and stability, and reactions from other people to the wearer of the light logger, were commonly mentioned aspects. CONCLUSION: In sum, the results indicate the miniaturisation of light loggers and &quot;invisible&quot; integration into extant everyday objects as key areas for future technological development, facilitating the availability of light exposure data for developing personalised intervention strategies in both research, clinical and consumer contexts.;,citation_author=E.

Measurements at eye level of 5000 lux or more corresponded to a difference between the devices of greater than 100 lux. Agreement between the eye- and wrist-level light measurements also appears to be influenced by time of day. During the day, the measurement differences were on average 50 lux higher at eye level, whereas at night they were on average 50 lux lower. Although the wrist-level monitor was found to underestimate light exposure at higher light levels, it was well tolerated by participants in the clinical setting. In contrast, the eye-level monitor was cumbersome and uncomfortable for the patients to wear. This study provides light-exposure data on patients in real conditions in the clinical environment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reactivity of measurement in health psychology: How much of a problem is it? What can be done about it?;,citation_abstract=PURPOSE: Measurement reactivity is defined as being present where measurement results in changes in the people being measured. The main aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge concerning the extent and nature of psychological measurement affecting people who complete the measures. Other aims are to describe how this may affect conclusions drawn in health psychology research and to outline where more research is needed. METHODS: Narrative review. RESULTS: Several studies, using a variety of methods, have found measurement procedures to alter subsequent cognition, emotion, and behaviour. In many instances, the effects obtained were of up to medium size. However, the extent to which such studies are representative is not clear: do other studies which find no reactive effects of measurement not exist or do they exist but are not reported? CONCLUSIONS: Although measurement reactivity can yield medium-sized effects, our understanding of this phenomenon is still rudimentary. We do not know the precise circumstances that are likely to result in measurement reactivity: we cannot predict when problems are more likely to arise. There is a particular absence of studies of the mechanisms by which measurement reactivity arises. There is a need for a systematic review of this literature, which should aim to quantify the extent of measurement reactivity effects and to provide a firmer evidence base for theorizing about the sources of reactivity.;,citation_author=D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=How to deal with darkness: Modeling and visualization of zero-inflated personal light exposure data on a logarithmic scale;,citation_abstract=Measuring and analyzing personal light exposure has become increasingly important in circadian and myopia research. Very small measurement values in light exposure patterns, especially zero, are regularly recorded in field studies. These zero-lux values are problematic for commonly applied logarithmic transformations and should neither be dismissed nor be unduly influential in visualizations and statistical modeling. We compare 4 ways to visualize such data on a linear, logarithmic, hybrid, or symlog scale, and we model the light exposure patterns with a generalized additive model by removing zero-lux values, adding a very small or −1 log10 lux value to the dataset, or using the Tweedie error distribution. We show that a symlog-transformed visualization, implemented in LightLogR, displays relevant features of light exposure across scales, including zero-lux, while reducing the emphasis on the small values (&amp;amp;amp;lt;1 lux). Symlog is well-suited to visualize differences in light exposure covering heavy-tailed negative values. We further show that small but not negligible value additions to the light exposure data of −1 log10 lux for statistical modeling allow for acceptable models on a logarithmic scale, while very small values distort results. We also demonstrate the utility of the Tweedie distribution, which does not require prior transformations, models data on a logarithmic scale, and includes zero-lux values, capturing personal light exposure patterns satisfactorily. Data from field studies of personal light exposure require appropriate handling of zero-lux values in a logarithmic context. Symlog scales for visualizations and an appropriate addition to input values for modeling, or the Tweedie distribution, provide a solid basis. Beyond light exposure, other time-series data relevant to biological rhythms, such as accelerometry for ambulatory sleep scoring in humans or wheel-running in animal models, exhibit zero inflation and can benefit from the methods introduced here.;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The visual experience evaluation tool: A myopia research instrument for quantifying visual experience;,citation_abstract=Current myopia research has demonstrated the role of extended visual experience in healthy ocular development. Optical cues and the spectrum, intensity, and temporal characteristics of light landing on the retina are all known factors affecting the development of the eye. However, there is still limited understanding as to which of these extrinsic factors are most important or how they interplay with intrinsic physical and neural differences between individuals. Part of the problem is inadequate tooling. Our team at Reality Labs Research created the Visual Environment Evaluation Tool (VEET), a non-commercial research instrument, to accelerate myopia research. In this paper, we describe the VEET’s physical design, sensor suite and capabilities, and the associated software which makes it well-suited for research of quantified visual experience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.;,citation_author=David Sullivan;,citation_author=Aaron Nicholls;,citation_author=George Hatoun;,citation_author=Samuel Thompson;,citation_author=Cory Schwarzmiller;,citation_author=Fathollah Memarzanjany;,citation_author=Alyssa Gunderson;,citation_author=Alexander Danielson;,citation_author=John Lowes;,citation_author=Jon Petersen;,citation_author=Sam Backes;,citation_author=Micah Thomas;,citation_author=Hanna Eha;,citation_author=Lisa Rutherford;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/09/23/2024.09.20.614212;,citation_doi=10.1101/2024.09.20.614212;,citation_journal_title=bioRxiv;,citation_publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Collecting, detecting and handling non-wear intervals in longitudinal light exposure data;,citation_abstract=In field studies using wearable light loggers, participants often need to remove the devices, resulting in non-wear intervals of varying and unknown duration. Accurate detection of these intervals is an essential step in data pre-processing pipelines. However, the limited reporting on whether and how non-wear information is collected and detected has hindered the development of effective data pre-processing strategies and automated detection algorithms. Here, we deploy a multi-modal approach to collect non-wear time during a longitudinal light exposure campaign and systematically compare non-wear detection strategies. Healthy participants (n=26; mean age 285 years, 14F) wore a near-corneal plane light logger for one week and reported non-wear events in three ways: pressing an “event marker” button on the light logger, placing it in a black bag, and using an app-based Wear log. Wear log entries were checked twice a day to ensure high data quality and used as ground truth for non-wear interval detection. Participants showed high adherence to the protocol, with non-wear time constituting 5.43.8% (meanSD) of total participation time. Considering button presses, our results indicated that extending time windows beyond one minute improved their detection at the start and end of non-wear intervals, achieving identification in &amp;amp;amp;gt;85.4% of cases. To detect non-wear intervals based on black bag use, we applied an algorithm detecting clusters of low illuminance to our data and compared its performance to detecting clusters of low activity. Performance was higher for illuminance (F1=0.76) than activity (F1=0.52). Transition states between wear and non-wear emerged as a major source of misclassification, and we suggest that combining illuminance and activity data could enhance detection accuracy. Lastly, we compared light exposure metrics averaged across the week derived from three datasets: the full dataset, a dataset filtered for non-wear based on self-reports, and a dataset filtered for non-wear using the low illuminance clusters detection algorithm. The differences in light exposure metrics across these datasets were minimal. Our results highlight that while non-wear detection may be less critical in high-compliance cohorts, systematically collecting and detecting non-wear intervals is both feasible and important for ensuring robust data pre-processing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.;,citation_author=Carolina Guidolin;,citation_author=Johannes Zauner;,citation_author=Steffen Lutz Hartmeyer;,citation_author=Manuel Spitschan;,citation_publication_date=2024;,citation_cover_date=2024;,citation_year=2024;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2024/12/23/2024.12.23.627604;,citation_doi=10.1101/2024.12.23.627604;,citation_journal_title=bioRxiv;,citation_publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory;">

        <p>Exposure to the optical environment — often referred to as <em>visual experience</em> — profoundly influences human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. In controlled laboratory settings, stimuli can be held constant or manipulated parametrically. However, such exposures rarely replicate real-world conditions, which are inherently complex and dynamic, generating high-dimensional datasets that demand rigorous and flexible analysis strategies. This tutorial presents an analysis pipeline for visual experience datasets, with a focus on reproducible workflows for human chronobiology and myopia research. Light exposure and its retinal encoding affect human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. Here we provide step-by-step instructions for importing, visualizing, and processing viewing distance and light exposure data. This includes time-series analyses for working distance, biologically relevant light metrics, and spectral characteristics. The tasks are standardized through the open-source R package <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/"><strong>LightLogR</strong></a>. By leveraging a modular approach, the tutorial supports researchers in building flexible and robust pipelines that accommodate diverse experimental paradigms and measurement systems.</p>

<p>Exposure to the optical environment — often referred to as <em>visual experience</em> — profoundly influences human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. Two notable examples, from distinct research domains, can be understood through a common retinally-referenced framework.</p>
<p>The first example relates to the non-visual effects of light on human circadian and neuroendocrine physiology. The light–dark cycle entrains the circadian clock, and light exposure at night suppresses melatonin production <span class="citation" data-cites="Brown2022PLoSBiol Blume2019Somnologie">(<a href="#ref-Brown2022PLoSBiol" role="doc-biblioref">Brown et al. 2022</a>; <a href="#ref-Blume2019Somnologie" role="doc-biblioref">Blume, Garbazza, and Spitschan 2019</a>)</span>. The second example concerns the influence of visual experience on ocular development, particularly myopia. Time spent outdoors — which features distinct optical environments — has been consistently associated with protective effects on ocular growth and health outcomes <span class="citation" data-cites="DahlmannNoor2025GraefesArchClinExpOphthal">(<a href="#ref-DahlmannNoor2025GraefesArchClinExpOphthal" role="doc-biblioref">Dahlmann-Noor et al. 2025</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In controlled laboratory settings, light exposure can be held constant or manipulated parametrically. In contrast, real-world conditions are inherently complex and dynamic, and cannot be captured by single spot measurements. As people move in and between spaces (indoors and outdoors) and move their body, head, and eyes, exposure to the optical environment varies significantly <span class="citation" data-cites="Webler2019CurrOpinBehavSci">(<a href="#ref-Webler2019CurrOpinBehavSci" role="doc-biblioref">Webler et al. 2019</a>)</span> and is modulated by behavior <span class="citation" data-cites="Biller2024CommunPsychol">(<a href="#ref-Biller2024CommunPsychol" role="doc-biblioref">Biller, Balakrishnan, and Spitschan 2024</a>)</span>. Wearable devices for measuring light exposure have thus emerged as vital tools to capture the ecological visual experience. These tools generate high-dimensional datasets that demand rigorous and flexible analysis strategies.</p>
<p>Starting in the 1980s <span class="citation" data-cites="Okudaira1983AmJPhysiol">(<a href="#ref-Okudaira1983AmJPhysiol" role="doc-biblioref">Okudaira, Kripke, and Webster 1983</a>)</span>, technology to measure optical exposure has matured, with miniaturized illuminance sensors now (in 2025) very common in consumer wearables <span class="citation" data-cites="vanDuijnhoven2025BuildEnviron">(<a href="#ref-vanDuijnhoven2025BuildEnviron" role="doc-biblioref">van Duijnhoven et al. 2025</a>)</span>. In research, several devices are available that differ in functionality, ranging from small pins measuring ambient illuminance <span class="citation" data-cites="Mohamed2021OptExpress">(<a href="#ref-Mohamed2021OptExpress" role="doc-biblioref">Mohamed et al. 2021</a>)</span> to head-mounted multi-modal devices capturing nearly all relevant aspects of visual experience <span class="citation" data-cites="Gibaldi2024TranslVisSciTechnol">(<a href="#ref-Gibaldi2024TranslVisSciTechnol" role="doc-biblioref">Gibaldi et al. 2024</a>)</span>. Increased capabilities in wearables bring complex, dense datasets. These go hand-in-hand with a proliferation of metrics, as highlighted by recent review papers in both circadian and myopia research <span class="citation" data-cites="Honekopp2023ClinOphthalmol Hartmeyer2023LightResTechnol">(<a href="#ref-Honekopp2023ClinOphthalmol" role="doc-biblioref">Hönekopp and Weigelt 2023</a>; <a href="#ref-Hartmeyer2023LightResTechnol" role="doc-biblioref">Hartmeyer and Andersen 2023</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>At present, the analysis processes to derive metrics are often implemented on a per-laboratory or even per-researcher basis. This fragmentation is a potential source of errors and inconsistencies between studies, consumes considerable researcher time <span class="citation" data-cites="Hartmeyer2022LightResTechnol">(<a href="#ref-Hartmeyer2022LightResTechnol" role="doc-biblioref">Hartmeyer, Webler, and Andersen 2022</a>)</span>, and these bespoke processes and formats hinder harmonization or meta-analysis across multiple studies. It is very common that more time is spent preparing data than gaining insights through rigorous statistical analysis. These preparation tasks are best handled, or at least facilitated, by standardized, transparent, community-based analysis pipelines <span class="citation" data-cites="Zauner2024PLOSONE">(<a href="#ref-Zauner2024PLOSONE" role="doc-biblioref">J. Zauner, Udovicic, and Spitschan 2024</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>In circadian research, the R package LightLogR was developed to address this need <span class="citation" data-cites="Zauner2025JOpenSourceSoftw">(<a href="#ref-Zauner2025JOpenSourceSoftw" role="doc-biblioref">J. Zauner, Hartmeyer, and Spitschan 2025</a>)</span>. LightLogR is an open-source, MIT-licensed, community-driven package specifically designed for data from wearable light loggers and optical radiation dosimeters. It contains functions to calculate over sixty different metrics used in the field <span class="citation" data-cites="Hartmeyer2023LightResTechnol">(<a href="#ref-Hartmeyer2023LightResTechnol" role="doc-biblioref">Hartmeyer and Andersen 2023</a>)</span>. The package functions come with light-related defaults, but they remain fundamentally agnostic to modality. As a result, parameters like viewing distance and light spectra, both highly relevant to myopia research <span class="citation" data-cites="Honekopp2023ClinOphthalmol">(<a href="#ref-Honekopp2023ClinOphthalmol" role="doc-biblioref">Hönekopp and Weigelt 2023</a>)</span>, can easily be handled.</p>
<p>In this article, we demonstrate that LightLogR’s analysis pipelines and metric functions apply broadly across the field of visual experience research, not just to circadian rhythms and chronobiology. Our approach is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to adapt it to a variety of devices and research questions. Emphasis is placed on clarity, transparency, and reproducibility, aligning with best practices in scientific computing and open science. We use example data from two devices (worn by different individuals and at different times) to showcase the LightLogR workflow with metrics relevant to myopia research, covering working distance, (day)light exposure, and spectral analysis. Readers are encouraged to recreate the analysis using the provided code. All necessary data and code are openly available in the <a href="https://github.com/tscnlab/ZaunerEtAl_JVis_2026">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

<p>This article focuses on workflows for deriving condensed metrics from time-series data collected with wearable devices in the visual-experience domain. Specifically, we address illuminance, viewing distance, and spectral irradiance. Example datasets from two types of wearable devices are used for illustration.</p>
<p>Many relevant considerations arise when collecting data with wearable devices. This article covers only a subset of these. In particular, it does not address:</p>
<ul>
<li>device selection (see, e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="vanDuijnhoven2025BuildEnviron Zauner2025LightResTech">(<a href="#ref-vanDuijnhoven2025BuildEnviron" role="doc-biblioref">van Duijnhoven et al. 2025</a>; <a href="#ref-Zauner2025LightResTech" role="doc-biblioref">Johannes Zauner et al. 2025</a>)</span>)</li>
<li>measurement accuracy or device calibration</li>
<li>auxiliary data such as sleep/wake information (see, e.g., <span class="citation" data-cites="Zauner2025npj Guidolin2025BehavResMethods">(<a href="#ref-Zauner2025npj" role="doc-biblioref">J. Zauner et al. 2025</a>; <a href="#ref-Guidolin2025BehavResMethods" role="doc-biblioref">Guidolin et al. 2024</a>)</span>)</li>
</ul>
<p>To demonstrate the workflows, this article uses expert-informed definitions of metrics and metric parameters (see, e.g., <a href="#tbl-one" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>, <a href="#tbl-two" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a>, and the non-wear detection rules based on activity data described in <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement&nbsp;1</a>). These definitions and thresholds should not be interpreted as universal standards, nor are they hard-coded into the software package. For any application, parameter choices must be tailored to the research domain, study context and design, and the specifications of the wearable device.</p>
<p>Further, the article is split up in the main analysis part, where all metrics are calculated, and the <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement&nbsp;1</a>, where data is imported, screened, and prepared. Thus, the reader is referred to <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement&nbsp;1</a> for all aspects regarding data formats, preparation steps, and handling of gaps, i.e., missing data.</p>
<p>Lastly, the example data used in the article do not stem from a controlled experimental data collection but consist of pilot data gathered in an ecological setting without a fixed protocol. Given the substantial interindividual differences in visual experience metrics, and because the analyses focus on one participant at a time, the reported results should be interpreted as illustrative rather than representative of typical or population-level values.</p>

<p>This tutorial was built with <code>Quarto</code>, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that integrates text, code, and code output into a single document. The source code to reproduce all results is included and accessible via the Quarto document’s <code>code tool</code> menu. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5.0, “How About a Twenty-Six”) using <code>LightLogR</code> (version&nbsp;0.10.0 “High noon”). We also used the <code>tidyverse</code> suite (version&nbsp;2.0.0) for data manipulation (which LightLogR follows in its design), and the <code>gt</code> package (version&nbsp;1.1.0) for generating summary tables. A comprehensive overview of the R computing environment is provided in the session info (see <a href="#sessioninfo">Session info</a> section).</p>

<p>In March 2025, two workshops with myopia researchers — initiated by the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Working Group on Optical Radiation Exposure and Visual Experience Data — focused on current needs and future opportunities in data analysis, including the development and standardization of metrics. Based on expert input from these workshops, the authors of this tutorial compiled a list of visual experience metrics, shown in <a href="#tbl-one" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;1</a>. These include many currently used metrics and definitions <span class="citation" data-cites="Wen2020bjophthalmol Wen2019TransVisSciTech Bhandari2020OphthalmicPhysiolOpt Williams2019Scientificreports">(<a href="#ref-Wen2020bjophthalmol" role="doc-biblioref">Wen et al. 2020</a>, <a href="#ref-Wen2019TransVisSciTech" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>; <a href="#ref-Bhandari2020OphthalmicPhysiolOpt" role="doc-biblioref">Bhandari and Ostrin 2020</a>; <a href="#ref-Williams2019Scientificreports" role="doc-biblioref">Williams et al. 2019</a>)</span>, as well as new metrics enabled by spectrally-resolved measurements.

<p>It should be noted that although daylight levels can far exceed the thresholds defined in <a href="#tbl-two" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;2</a> - and may reach or even exceed 10^5 lux - empirical daylight levels measured at eye level are much lower, typically around 10^3 lux, especially when considering aggregated time-series data over minutes to hours.</p>

<p>Data from two wearable devices are used in this analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Clouclip</code>: A wearable device that measures viewing distance and ambient light simultaneously [Glasson Technology Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, China; <span class="citation" data-cites="Wen2021ActaOphtalmol">Wen et al. (<a href="#ref-Wen2021ActaOphtalmol" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="Wen2020bjophthalmol">Wen et al. (<a href="#ref-Wen2020bjophthalmol" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>]. The Clouclip provides a simple data output with only distance (working distance, in centimeters) and illuminance (ambient light, in lux). Data in our example were recorded at 5-second intervals. Approximately one week of data (~120,960 observations) is about 1.6&nbsp;MB in size.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Visual Environment Evaluation Tool</code> (VEET): A head-mounted multi-modal device that logs multiple data streams [Reality Labs Research, Menlo Park, CA, USA; <span class="citation" data-cites="Sah2025OphtalmicPhysiolOpt">Sah, Narra, and Ostrin (<a href="#ref-Sah2025OphtalmicPhysiolOpt" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span>; <span class="citation" data-cites="Sullivan2024">Sullivan et al. (<a href="#ref-Sullivan2024" role="doc-biblioref">2024</a>)</span>]. The VEET dataset used here contains simultaneous measurements of distance (via a time-of-flight sensor), ambient light (illuminance), activity (accelerometer &amp; gyroscope), and spectral irradiance (multi-channel light sensor). Data were recorded at 2-second intervals, yielding a very dense dataset (~270&nbsp;MB per week).</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="data-processing-summary" class="level3" data-number="2.4">
<h3 data-number="2.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-processing-summary"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Data processing summary</h3>
<p>The <a href="#results">Results</a> section uses imported and pre-processed data from the two devices to calculate metrics. <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement&nbsp;1</a> contains the annotated code and description for the steps involved. The following summarizes the steps involved, please refer to the supplement for details:</p>
<p><strong>Data import:</strong> We imported raw data from the <code>Clouclip</code> and <code>VEET</code> devices using LightLogR’s built-in import functions, which automatically handle device-specific formats and idiosyncrasies.</p>
<p>The <code>Clouclip</code> export file (provided as a tab-delimited text file) contains timestamped records of distance (cm) and illuminance (lux). LightLogR’s <code>import$Clouclip</code> function reads this file, after specifying the device’s recording timezone, and converts device-specific sentinel codes into proper missing values. For instance, the Clouclip uses special numeric codes to indicate when it is in “sleep mode” or when a reading is out of the sensor’s range, rather than recording a normal value. LightLogR identifies <code>-1</code> (for both distance and lux) as indicating the device’s sleep mode and <code>204</code> (for distance) as indicating the object was beyond the measurable range, replacing these with <code>NA</code> and logging their status in separate columns. The import routine also provides an initial summary of the dataset, including start and end times and any irregular sampling intervals or gaps.</p>
<p>For the <code>VEET</code> device, data were provided as CSV logs (zipped on Github, due to size). We focused on the ambient light sensor modality first. Using <code>import$VEET(..., modality = "ALS")</code>, we extracted the illuminance (<code>Lux</code>) data stream and its timestamps. The raw VEET data similarly contains irregular intervals and can contain missing periods (e.g., if the device stopped recording or was reset); the import summary flags these issues.</p>
<p>Besides the <code>Clouclip</code> and <code>VEET</code>, LightLogR 0.10.0 contains import functions for 18 more wearable devices. The package further supports versions due to evolving data formats, and includes documentation for both <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/import_adjustment.html">code-based</a> and <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/Import.html#from-which-devices-can-i-import-data">code-less</a> additions of new device import-functions.</p>
<p><strong>Irregular intervals, gaps, non-wear times:</strong> Both datasets showed irregular timing and missing data, i.e., gaps. Irregular data means that some observations did not align to the nominal sampling interval (e.g., slight timing drift or pauses in recording). For the <code>Clouclip</code> 5-second data, we detected irregular timestamps spanning all but the first and last day of the recording. Handling such irregularities is important because many downstream analyses assume a regular time series. We evaluated strategies to address this, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Removing an initial portion of data if irregularities occur mainly during device start-up.</p></li>
<li><p>Rounding all timestamps to the nearest regular interval (5&nbsp;s in this case).</p></li>
<li><p>Aggregating to a coarser time interval (with some loss of temporal resolution).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the import summary and visual inspection of the time gaps, we chose to round the observation times to the nearest 5-second mark, as this addressed the minor offsets without significant data loss. After rounding timestamps, we added an explicit date column for convenient grouping by day.</p>
<p>We then generated a summary of missing data for each day. Implicit gaps (intervals where the device should have recorded data but did not) were converted into explicit missing entries using LightLogR’s gap-handling functions. We also removed days that had very little data to focus on days with substantial wear time. In our <code>Clouclip</code> example, days with &lt;1&nbsp;hour of recordings were dropped. This threshold should be adjusted based on how much complete days matter for a given analysis at hand. E.g., in circadian science, the metrics of <em>interdaily stability</em> and <em>intradaily variation</em> require measurements for each hour of the day.</p>
<p>After these preprocessing steps, the <code>Clouclip</code> dataset had no irregular timestamps remaining and contained explicit markers for all periods of missing data (e.g., times when the device was off or not worn). The distance and illuminance values were now ready for metric calculations. Because the device was put in <code>sleep mode</code> when not worn, there are no measurements during non-wear times.</p>
<p>The <code>VEET</code> illuminance data underwent a similar cleaning procedure. To make the <code>VEET</code>’s 2-second illuminance data more comparable to the <code>Clouclip</code>’s and to reduce computational load, we aggregated the illuminance time series to 5-second intervals. Aggregation was performed with the arithmetic mean of values in a 5-second bin. We then inserted explicit missing entries for each whole day and removed days with more than one hour of missing illuminance data. After cleaning, six days of <code>VEET</code> illuminance data with good coverage remained for analysis (see <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement 1</a> for details).</p>
<p>Finally, for spectral analysis, we imported the <code>VEET</code>’s spectral sensor modality, and, for the distance analysis, the time-of-flight modality. This required additional processing: the raw spectral data consists of counts from 10 wavelength-specific channels (approximately 415&nbsp;nm through 940&nbsp;nm, unequally spaced between 30 and 50 nm, plus one broadband clear channel covering the whole range of individual channels and a dark channel) along with a sensor gain setting. We aggregated the spectral data to 5-minute intervals to focus on broader trends and reduce data volume. Each channel’s counts were normalized by the appropriate gain. Using a calibration matrix provided by the manufacturer (specific to the spectral sensor model), we reconstructed full spectral power distributions for each 5-minute interval. The end result is a list-column in the dataset where each entry is the estimated spectral irradiance across wavelengths for that time interval. Detailed spectral preprocessing steps, including the calibration and normalization, are provided in the <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement 1</a>. After spectral reconstruction, the dataset was ready for calculating example spectrum-based metrics.</p>
<p>Similarly, the time-of-flight modality contains 256 values per observation, encoding an 8x8 grid of distance and confidence measurements for up to two objects (8x8 grid, times two objects, times distance + confidence column for each object and grid point -&gt; 256 values). For computational reasons, only the first object was kept. These data were pivoted into a long format, where each row contains the distance and confidence data for a given position in the grid and a given datetime. After pivoting and converting grid positions into a deviation angle from central view, the dataset was ready to be used for distance analysis.</p>
<p>Because the <code>VEET</code> devices record even when not worn, a non-wear detection using the devices’ actigraphy modality was implemented. This process used the standard deviation of a linear motion sensor in a 5-minute bin with a visually derived threshold to separate wear from non-wear time. Measurements of illuminance and distance were consequently removed during the calculated non-wear times.</p>
<p>This tutorial will start by importing a <code>Clouclip</code> dataset and providing an overview of the data. The <code>Clouclip</code> export is considerably simpler compared to the <code>VEET</code> export, only containing <code>Distance</code> and <code>Illuminance</code> measurements. The <code>VEET</code> dataset will be imported later for the spectrum related metrics.</p>

Many distance-based metrics are computed for each day and then averaged over weekdays, weekends, or across all days. To facilitate this, we define a helper function that will take daily metric values and calculate the mean values for weekdays, weekends, and the overall daily average:</p>

<p>Continuous near-work can be understood as sustained viewing within a near distance for some minimum duration, allowing only brief interruptions. We use LightLogR’s <code>cluster</code> function to identify episodes of continuous near work. Here, we define a near-work episode as viewing distance between 20&nbsp;cm and 60&nbsp;cm that lasts at least 30&nbsp;minutes, with interruptions of up to 1&nbsp;minute allowed (meaning short breaks ≤1&nbsp;min do not end the episode). Using <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/extract_clusters.html">extract_clusters()</a> with those parameters, we count how many such episodes occur per day.</p>
<p><a href="#tbl-continuousnear" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;6</a> summarizes the average frequency of continuous near-work episodes per day, and <a href="#fig-visbreak" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> provides an example visualization of these episodes on the distance time series.</p>

<p>Beyond frequency, we can characterize near-work episodes by their duration and typical viewing distance. This section extracts all near-work episodes (using a 5-second minimum duration to capture more routine near-work bouts) and summarizes three aspects:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>frequency (count of episodes per day),</li>
<li>average duration of episodes, and</li>
<li>average distance during those episodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>These results are combined in <a href="#tbl-nearworkepisodes" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;7</a>.</p>

<p>The <code>Clouclip</code> device outputs a singular measure for distance, while the visual environment in natural conditions contains many distances, depending on the solid angle and direction of the measurement. A device like the <code>VEET</code> increases the spatial resolution of these measurements, allowing for more in-depth analyses of the size and position of an object within the field of view. In the case of the <code>VEET</code>, data are collected from an 8x8 measurement grid, spanning 52° vertically and 41° horizontally. Here are sample observations from six different days at the same time.</p>

<p>To use these distance data in the framework shown above for the <code>Clouclip</code> device, a sensible method to condense the data has to be applied. There are many ways how a spatially resolved distance measure could be utilized for analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in the field of view are objects in close range?</li>
<li>How large are near objects in the field of view?</li>
<li>How varied are distances within the field of view?</li>
<li>How close are objects / is viewing distance in a region of interest within the field of view?</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible methods include:</p>
<ul>
<li>average across all (high confidence) distance values within the grid</li>
<li>closest (high confidence) distance within the grid</li>
<li>(high confidence) values at or around a given grid position, e.g., ±10 degrees around the central view (0°)</li>
</ul>
<p>Many more options are available based on the spatial dataset, e.g., condensation rules based on the number of points in the grid with a given condition, or the variation within the grid.</p>
<p>We will demonstrate these three methods for a single day (<code>2024-06-10</code>), all leading to a data structure akin to the <code>Clouclip</code>, i.e., to be used for further calculation of visual experience metrics.</p>

<p>As can be seen in <a href="#fig-VEET-distance_methods" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;5</a>, while the overall pattern is similar regardless of the used method, there are notable differences between the methods, which will consequently affect downstream analyses. Most importantly, the process of condensation has to be well documented and reproducible, as shown above. Any of these data could now be used to calculate the <code>frequency of continuous near work</code>, <code>visual breaks</code>, or <code>near-work episodes</code> as described above.</p>

<p>The <code>Clouclip</code> illuminance data in our example cover indoor environments and are thus comparatively low, which would make certain daylight exposure summaries trivial or not meaningful. To better illustrate light exposure metrics, we turn to a different dataset, this one taken from the <code>VEET</code> device’s illuminance data, which capture a broader range of lighting conditions (though both device types are able to capture broadly the same range of illuminance). We import the <code>VEET</code> ambient light data (already preprocessed to have regular 5-second intervals as described above) and briefly examine its distribution.</p>
<p><strong>Illuminance distribution</strong>: The illuminance values from the <code>Clouclip</code> were comparatively low, while the <code>VEET</code> data include outdoor exposures up to several thousand lux. The contrast is evident from comparing histograms of the two datasets’ lux values (<code>Clouclip</code> vs.&nbsp;<code>VEET</code>), where the main peak is similarly positioned between 10 and 100 lx, but the tails differ. The <code>VEET</code> illuminance histogram (see <a href="#fig-hist-VEETlight" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a>) shows a heavily skewed distribution with a considerable number of zero lx values (indicating intervals of complete darkness or the sensor being covered) and a long tail extending to very high lux values. Such zero-inflated and skewed data are common in wearable light measurements <span class="citation" data-cites="ZaunerEtAl2025JBR">(<a href="#ref-ZaunerEtAl2025JBR" role="doc-biblioref">J.

<p>After confirming that the <code>VEET</code> data cover a broad dynamic range of lighting, we proceed with calculating light exposure metrics. (The VEET data had been cleaned for gaps and irregularities as described earlier, and non-wear times were removed; see <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement&nbsp;1</a> for the details.)</p>

<p>However, because illuminance data tend to be extremely skewed and contain many zero values (periods of darkness), the arithmetic mean can be <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/log.html">misleading</a>. A common approach is to apply a logarithmic transform to illuminance before averaging, which down-weights extreme values and accounts for the multiplicative nature of light intensity effects. LightLogR provides helper functions <a href="(https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/log_zero_inflated.html)"><code>log_zero_inflated()</code></a> and its inverse <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/log_zero_inflated.html"><code>exp_zero_inflated()</code></a> to handle log-transformation when zeros are present (by adding a small offset before log, and back-transforming after averaging). Using this approach, we recompute the daily mean illuminance. The results in <a href="#tbl-lightexposure2" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;10</a> show that the log-transformed mean (back-transformed to lux) is much lower, reflecting the fact that for much of the time illuminance was near zero. This transformed mean is often more representative of typical exposure for skewed data.</p>

<p>Another important metric is the amount of time spent under bright light, often used as a proxy for outdoor exposure. We define thresholds corresponding to outdoor light levels (e.g.&nbsp;1000&nbsp;lx and above). Here, we categorize each 5-second interval of illuminance into bands: Outdoor bright (≥1000&nbsp;lx), Outdoor very bright (≥2000&nbsp;lx), and Outdoor extremely bright (≥3000&nbsp;lx). We then sum the duration in each category per day.</p>
<p>While daylight levels can far exceed the recorded light levels, those are usually recorded with direct sunlight and without obstruction. Under normal viewing conditions, at eye level, and avoiding glare, daylight levels of a few thousand lux are at the higher end of the distribution <span class="citation" data-cites="murukesu2025ADID">(<a href="#ref-murukesu2025ADID" role="doc-biblioref">Murukesu, Zauner, and Spitschan 2025</a>)</span>. <a href="#fig-hist-VEETlight" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;7</a> shows a bimodal distribution, with the right mode representing outdoor lighting conditions.

<p>We next consider how often the subject moved from an indoor light environment to an outdoor-equivalent environment. We operationally define an “outdoor transition” as a change from &lt;1000&nbsp;lx to ≥1000&nbsp;lx. Using the cleaned <code>VEET</code> data, we extract all instances where illuminance crosses that threshold from below to above.</p>
<p><a href="#tbl-changesoutdoor" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;12</a> shows the average number of such transitions per day. Note that if data are recorded at a fine temporal resolution (5&nbsp;s here), very brief excursions above 1000&nbsp;lx could count as transitions and inflate this number. Indeed, the initial count is fairly high, reflecting fleeting spikes above 1000&nbsp;lx that might not represent meaningful outdoor exposures.</p>

<p>To obtain a more meaningful measure, we can require that the outdoor state persists for some minimum duration to count as a true transition (filtering out momentary fluctuations around the 1000&nbsp;lx mark). For example, we can require that once ≥1000&nbsp;lx is reached, it continues for at least 5&nbsp;minutes (allowing short interruptions up to 20&nbsp;s). <a href="#tbl-changesoutdoor2" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;13</a> applies this criterion, resulting in a lower, more plausible transition count.</p>

<p>The final light exposure metric we illustrate is the longest continuous period above a certain illuminance threshold (often termed longest period above threshold, e.g.&nbsp;PAT<sub>1000</sub> for 1000&nbsp;lx). This gives us a sense of the longest outdoor exposure in a day. Along with it, one might report the total duration above that threshold in the day (TAT<sub>1000</sub>). While we could derive these from the earlier analyses, LightLogR provides dedicated <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/Metrics.html">metric</a> functions for such calculations, which can compute multiple related metrics at once.</p>
<p>Using the function <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/period_above_threshold.html">period_above_threshold()</a> for PAT and <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/duration_above_threshold.html">duration_above_threshold()</a> for TAT, we calculate both metrics for the 1000&nbsp;lx threshold. <a href="#tbl-periodoutdoor" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;14</a> shows the mean of these metrics across days (i.e., average longest bright period and average total bright time per day).</p>

<p>Note that while imports from different devices can be <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/join_datasets.html">merged</a>, devices differ in their sensors, electronics, housing or diffuser form factors, and on-device data-processing pipelines. All of these factors affect the comparability of measurements, even when devices output the same variable (e.g., illuminance or distance). If data from different devices with the same measurement variable are to be merged, the corresponding variable names should be standardized beforehand - for example, renaming <code>Lux</code> and <code>LIGHT</code> to <code>illuminance</code>. If we wanted to analyse the <code>VEET</code> data together with the <code>Clouclip</code> data, for example, we would not have to rename anything, as both carry their illuminance measurements in the variable <code>Lux</code>. The following example shows how the combination of datasets would lead to a combined dataset, and how that would affect analysis outcomes. <strong>It is the responsibility of the researcher to perform device calibration and/or checks for a similar measurement fidelity.</strong></p>

<p>The <code>VEET</code> device’s spectral sensor provides multimodal data beyond simple lux values, but it requires reconstruction of the actual light spectrum from raw sensor counts. We processed the spectral sensor data in order to compute two example spectrum-based metrics. Detailed data import, normalization, and spectral reconstruction steps are given in <a href="./supplement-preview.html">Supplement&nbsp;1</a>; here we present the resulting metrics. Briefly, the <code>VEET</code>’s spectral sensor recorded counts in ten wavelength bands (roughly 415&nbsp;nm to 910&nbsp;nm), plus a <code>Dark</code> and a <code>Clear</code> channel<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. After normalizing by sensor gain and applying the calibration matrix, we obtained an estimated spectral irradiance distribution for each 5-minute interval in the recording. With these reconstructed spectra, we can derive novel metrics that consider spectral content of the light.</p>

<p>Our first spectral metric is the ratio of short-wavelength light to long-wavelength light, which is relevant, for example, in assessing the blue-light content of exposure. We define “short” wavelengths as 400–500&nbsp;nm and “long” as 600–700&nbsp;nm (which are not standardized threshold and can be freely adjusted). Using the list-column of spectra in our dataset, we integrate each spectrum over these ranges (using <a href="https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/spectral_integration.html"><code>spectral_integration()</code></a>), and then compute the ratio short/long for each time interval. We then summarize these ratios per day.</p>

Results are shown in <a href="#tbl-mder" class="quarto-xref">Table&nbsp;16</a>. In this case, instead of a simple integration over a wavelength band, we apply an action spectrum to the spectral power distribution (SPD), integrate over the weighted SPD, and apply a correction factor. All alphaopic action spectra are implemented in the <code>spectral_integration()</code> function. These will result in photopic illuminance and melanopic equivalent daylight illuminance (melEDI)</p>

<p>The third spectral example examines short-wavelength light exposure as a function of time of day. Certain studies might be interested in, for instance, blue-light exposure during midday versus morning or night. We demonstrate three approaches: (a) filtering the data to a specific local time window, and (b) aggregating by hour of day to see a daily profile of short-wavelength exposure. Additionally, we (c) look at differences between day and night periods.</p>

<p>This tutorial demonstrates a standardized, step-by-step pipeline to calculate a variety of visual experience metrics. We illustrated how a combination of LightLogR functions and tidyverse workflows can yield clear and reproducible analyses for wearable device data. While the full pipeline is detailed, each metric is computed through a dedicated sequence of well-documented steps, yet remains configurable to realize different metric definitions or thresholds.</p>
<p>By leveraging LightLogR’s framework alongside common data analysis approaches, the process remains transparent and relatively easy to follow. The overall goal is to make analysis transparent (with open-source functions), accessible (through thorough documentation, tutorials, and human-readable function naming, all under an MIT license), robust (the package includes &gt;900 unit tests and continuous integration with bug tracking on GitHub), and community-driven (open feature requests and contributions via GitHub).</p>
<p>Even with standardized pipelines, researchers must still make and document many decisions during data cleaning, time-series handling, and metric calculations — especially for complex metrics that involve grouping data in multiple ways (for example, grouping by distance range as well as by duration for cluster metrics). We have highlighted these decision points in the tutorial (such as how to handle irregular intervals, choosing thresholds for “near” distances or “outdoor” light, and deciding on minimum durations for sustained events). Explicitly considering and reporting these choices is important for reproducibility and for comparing results across studies.</p>
<p>The broad set of features in LightLogR — ranging from data import and cleaning tools (for handling time gaps and irregularities) to visualization functions and metric calculators — make it a powerful toolkit for visual experience research. Our examples spanned circadian-light metrics and myopia-related metrics, demonstrating the versatility of a unified analysis approach. By using community-supported tools and workflows, researchers in vision science, chronobiology, myopia, and related fields can reduce time spent on low-level data wrangling and focus more on interpreting results and advancing scientific understanding.</p>

<span id="cb43-28"><a href="#cb43-28"></a><span class="co">  Exposure to the optical environment — often referred to as *visual experience* — profoundly influences human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. In controlled laboratory settings, stimuli can be held constant or manipulated parametrically. However, such exposures rarely replicate real-world conditions, which are inherently complex and dynamic, generating high-dimensional datasets that demand rigorous and flexible analysis strategies. This tutorial presents an analysis pipeline for visual experience datasets, with a focus on reproducible workflows for human chronobiology and myopia research. Light exposure and its retinal encoding affect human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. Here we provide step-by-step instructions for importing, visualizing, and processing viewing distance and light exposure data. This includes time-series analyses for working distance, biologically relevant light metrics, and spectral characteristics. The tasks are standardized through the open-source R package [**LightLogR**](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/). By leveraging a modular approach, the tutorial supports researchers in building flexible and robust pipelines that accommodate diverse experimental paradigms and measurement systems.</span></span>

<span id="cb43-63"><a href="#cb43-63"></a></span>

<span id="cb43-65"><a href="#cb43-65"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-66"><a href="#cb43-66"></a>Exposure to the optical environment — often referred to as *visual experience* — profoundly influences human physiology and behavior across multiple time scales. Two notable examples, from distinct research domains, can be understood through a common retinally-referenced framework.</span>
<span id="cb43-67"><a href="#cb43-67"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-68"><a href="#cb43-68"></a>The first example relates to the non-visual effects of light on human circadian and neuroendocrine physiology. The light–dark cycle entrains the circadian clock, and light exposure at night suppresses melatonin production <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Brown2022PLoSBiol; @Blume2019Somnologie</span><span class="co">]</span>. The second example concerns the influence of visual experience on ocular development, particularly myopia. Time spent outdoors — which features distinct optical environments — has been consistently associated with protective effects on ocular growth and health outcomes <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@DahlmannNoor2025GraefesArchClinExpOphthal</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb43-69"><a href="#cb43-69"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-70"><a href="#cb43-70"></a>In controlled laboratory settings, light exposure can be held constant or manipulated parametrically. In contrast, real-world conditions are inherently complex and dynamic, and cannot be captured by single spot measurements. As people move in and between spaces (indoors and outdoors) and move their body, head, and eyes, exposure to the optical environment varies significantly <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Webler2019CurrOpinBehavSci</span><span class="co">]</span> and is modulated by behavior <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Biller2024CommunPsychol</span><span class="co">]</span>. Wearable devices for measuring light exposure have thus emerged as vital tools to capture the ecological visual experience. These tools generate high-dimensional datasets that demand rigorous and flexible analysis strategies.</span>
<span id="cb43-71"><a href="#cb43-71"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-72"><a href="#cb43-72"></a>Starting in the 1980s <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Okudaira1983AmJPhysiol</span><span class="co">]</span>, technology to measure optical exposure has matured, with miniaturized illuminance sensors now (in 2025) very common in consumer wearables <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vanDuijnhoven2025BuildEnviron</span><span class="co">]</span>. In research, several devices are available that differ in functionality, ranging from small pins measuring ambient illuminance <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Mohamed2021OptExpress</span><span class="co">]</span> to head-mounted multi-modal devices capturing nearly all relevant aspects of visual experience <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Gibaldi2024TranslVisSciTechnol</span><span class="co">]</span>. Increased capabilities in wearables bring complex, dense datasets. These go hand-in-hand with a proliferation of metrics, as highlighted by recent review papers in both circadian and myopia research <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Honekopp2023ClinOphthalmol; @Hartmeyer2023LightResTechnol</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb43-73"><a href="#cb43-73"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-74"><a href="#cb43-74"></a>At present, the analysis processes to derive metrics are often implemented on a per-laboratory or even per-researcher basis. This fragmentation is a potential source of errors and inconsistencies between studies, consumes considerable researcher time <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Hartmeyer2022LightResTechnol</span><span class="co">]</span>, and these bespoke processes and formats hinder harmonization or meta-analysis across multiple studies. It is very common that more time is spent preparing data than gaining insights through rigorous statistical analysis. These preparation tasks are best handled, or at least facilitated, by standardized, transparent, community-based analysis pipelines <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Zauner2024PLOSONE</span><span class="co">]</span>.</span>
<span id="cb43-75"><a href="#cb43-75"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-76"><a href="#cb43-76"></a>In circadian research, the R package LightLogR was developed to address this need <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Zauner2025JOpenSourceSoftw</span><span class="co">]</span>. LightLogR is an open-source, MIT-licensed, community-driven package specifically designed for data from wearable light loggers and optical radiation dosimeters. It contains functions to calculate over sixty different metrics used in the field <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Hartmeyer2023LightResTechnol</span><span class="co">]</span>. The package functions come with light-related defaults, but they remain fundamentally agnostic to modality. As a result, parameters like viewing distance and light spectra, both highly relevant to myopia research <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Honekopp2023ClinOphthalmol</span><span class="co">]</span>, can easily be handled.</span>
<span id="cb43-77"><a href="#cb43-77"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-78"><a href="#cb43-78"></a>In this article, we demonstrate that LightLogR’s analysis pipelines and metric functions apply broadly across the field of visual experience research, not just to circadian rhythms and chronobiology. Our approach is modular and extensible, allowing researchers to adapt it to a variety of devices and research questions. Emphasis is placed on clarity, transparency, and reproducibility, aligning with best practices in scientific computing and open science. We use example data from two devices (worn by different individuals and at different times) to showcase the LightLogR workflow with metrics relevant to myopia research, covering working distance, (day)light exposure, and spectral analysis. Readers are encouraged to recreate the analysis using the provided code. All necessary data and code are openly available in the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">GitHub repository</span><span class="co">](https://github.com/tscnlab/ZaunerEtAl_JVis_2026)</span>.</span>

<span id="cb43-81"><a href="#cb43-81"></a><span class="fu">### Scope</span></span>
<span id="cb43-82"><a href="#cb43-82"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-83"><a href="#cb43-83"></a>This article focuses on workflows for deriving condensed metrics from time-series data collected with wearable devices in the visual-experience domain. Specifically, we address illuminance, viewing distance, and spectral irradiance. Example datasets from two types of wearable devices are used for illustration.</span>
<span id="cb43-84"><a href="#cb43-84"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-85"><a href="#cb43-85"></a>Many relevant considerations arise when collecting data with wearable devices. This article covers only a subset of these. In particular, it does not address:</span>
<span id="cb43-86"><a href="#cb43-86"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-87"><a href="#cb43-87"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>device selection (see, e.g., <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@vanDuijnhoven2025BuildEnviron; @Zauner2025LightResTech</span><span class="co">]</span>)</span>
<span id="cb43-88"><a href="#cb43-88"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>measurement accuracy or device calibration</span>
<span id="cb43-89"><a href="#cb43-89"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>auxiliary data such as sleep/wake information (see, e.g., <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Zauner2025npj; @Guidolin2025BehavResMethods</span><span class="co">]</span>)</span>
<span id="cb43-90"><a href="#cb43-90"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-91"><a href="#cb43-91"></a>To demonstrate the workflows, this article uses expert-informed definitions of metrics and metric parameters (see, e.g., @tbl-one, @tbl-two, and the non-wear detection rules based on activity data described in <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supplement&nbsp;1</span><span class="co">](supplement.qmd)</span>). These definitions and thresholds should not be interpreted as universal standards, nor are they hard-coded into the software package. For any application, parameter choices must be tailored to the research domain, study context and design, and the specifications of the wearable device.</span>
<span id="cb43-92"><a href="#cb43-92"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-93"><a href="#cb43-93"></a>Further, the article is split up in the main analysis part, where all metrics are calculated, and the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supplement&nbsp;1</span><span class="co">](supplement.qmd)</span>, where data is imported, screened, and prepared. Thus, the reader is referred to <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supplement&nbsp;1</span><span class="co">](supplement.qmd)</span> for all aspects regarding data formats, preparation steps, and handling of gaps, i.e., missing data.</span>
<span id="cb43-94"><a href="#cb43-94"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-95"><a href="#cb43-95"></a>Lastly, the example data used in the article do not stem from a controlled experimental data collection but consist of pilot data gathered in an ecological setting without a fixed protocol. Given the substantial interindividual differences in visual experience metrics, and because the analyses focus on one participant at a time, the reported results should be interpreted as illustrative rather than representative of typical or population-level values.</span>

<span id="cb43-102"><a href="#cb43-102"></a>This tutorial was built with <span class="in">`Quarto`</span>, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that integrates text, code, and code output into a single document. The source code to reproduce all results is included and accessible via the Quarto document's <span class="in">`code tool`</span> menu. All analyses were conducted in R (version 4.5.0, "How About a Twenty-Six") using <span class="in">`LightLogR`</span> (version&nbsp;0.10.0 "High noon"). We also used the <span class="in">`tidyverse`</span> suite (version&nbsp;2.0.0) for data manipulation (which LightLogR follows in its design), and the <span class="in">`gt`</span> package (version&nbsp;1.1.0) for generating summary tables.

<span id="cb43-105"><a href="#cb43-105"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-106"><a href="#cb43-106"></a>In March 2025, two workshops with myopia researchers — initiated by the Research Data Alliance (RDA) Working Group on Optical Radiation Exposure and Visual Experience Data — focused on current needs and future opportunities in data analysis, including the development and standardization of metrics. Based on expert input from these workshops, the authors of this tutorial compiled a list of visual experience metrics, shown in @tbl-one. These include many currently used metrics and definitions <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">@Wen2020bjophthalmol; @Wen2019TransVisSciTech; @Bhandari2020OphthalmicPhysiolOpt; @Williams2019Scientificreports</span><span class="co">]</span>, as well as new metrics enabled by spectrally-resolved measurements. While they are not derived by a formal consensus process, they are expert-informed and used in current scientific research, and thus will serve as example-definitions for metrics and thresholds throughout this article.</span>

<span id="cb43-114"><a href="#cb43-114"></a>It should be noted that although daylight levels can far exceed the thresholds defined in @tbl-two - and may reach or even exceed 10^5 lux - empirical daylight levels measured at eye level are much lower, typically around 10^3 lux, especially when considering aggregated time-series data over minutes to hours.</span>

<span id="cb43-126"><a href="#cb43-126"></a>The <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Results</span><span class="co">](#results)</span> section uses imported and pre-processed data from the two devices to calculate metrics. <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supplement&nbsp;1</span><span class="co">](supplement.qmd)</span> contains the annotated code and description for the steps involved. The following summarizes the steps involved, please refer to the supplement for details:</span>
<span id="cb43-127"><a href="#cb43-127"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-128"><a href="#cb43-128"></a>**Data import:** We imported raw data from the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> and <span class="in">`VEET`</span> devices using LightLogR’s built-in import functions, which automatically handle device-specific formats and idiosyncrasies. </span>
<span id="cb43-129"><a href="#cb43-129"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-130"><a href="#cb43-130"></a>The <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> export file (provided as a tab-delimited text file) contains timestamped records of distance (cm) and illuminance (lux). LightLogR’s <span class="in">`import$Clouclip`</span> function reads this file, after specifying the device’s recording timezone, and converts device-specific sentinel codes into proper missing values. For instance, the Clouclip uses special numeric codes to indicate when it is in “sleep mode” or when a reading is out of the sensor’s range, rather than recording a normal value. LightLogR identifies <span class="in">`-1`</span> (for both distance and lux) as indicating the device’s sleep mode and <span class="in">`204`</span> (for distance) as indicating the object was beyond the measurable range, replacing these with <span class="in">`NA`</span> and logging their status in separate columns. The import routine also provides an initial summary of the dataset, including start and end times and any irregular sampling intervals or gaps.</span>
<span id="cb43-131"><a href="#cb43-131"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-132"><a href="#cb43-132"></a>For the <span class="in">`VEET`</span> device, data were provided as CSV logs (zipped on Github, due to size). We focused on the ambient light sensor modality first. Using <span class="in">`import$VEET(..., modality = "ALS")`</span>, we extracted the illuminance (<span class="in">`Lux`</span>) data stream and its timestamps. The raw VEET data similarly contains irregular intervals and can contain missing periods (e.g., if the device stopped recording or was reset); the import summary flags these issues.</span>
<span id="cb43-133"><a href="#cb43-133"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-134"><a href="#cb43-134"></a>Besides the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> and <span class="in">`VEET`</span>, LightLogR 0.10.0 contains import functions for 18 more wearable devices. The package further supports versions due to evolving data formats, and includes documentation for both <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">code-based</span><span class="co">](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/import_adjustment.html)</span> and <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">code-less</span><span class="co">](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/Import.html#from-which-devices-can-i-import-data)</span> additions of new device import-functions.</span>
<span id="cb43-135"><a href="#cb43-135"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-136"><a href="#cb43-136"></a>**Irregular intervals, gaps, non-wear times:** Both datasets showed irregular timing and missing data, i.e., gaps. Irregular data means that some observations did not align to the nominal sampling interval (e.g., slight timing drift or pauses in recording). For the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> 5-second data, we detected irregular timestamps spanning all but the first and last day of the recording. Handling such irregularities is important because many downstream analyses assume a regular time series. We evaluated strategies to address this, including:</span>
<span id="cb43-137"><a href="#cb43-137"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-138"><a href="#cb43-138"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>Removing an initial portion of data if irregularities occur mainly during device start-up.</span>
<span id="cb43-139"><a href="#cb43-139"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-140"><a href="#cb43-140"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>Rounding all timestamps to the nearest regular interval (5&nbsp;s in this case).</span>
<span id="cb43-141"><a href="#cb43-141"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-142"><a href="#cb43-142"></a><span class="ss">-   </span>Aggregating to a coarser time interval (with some loss of temporal resolution).</span>
<span id="cb43-143"><a href="#cb43-143"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-144"><a href="#cb43-144"></a>Based on the import summary and visual inspection of the time gaps, we chose to round the observation times to the nearest 5-second mark, as this addressed the minor offsets without significant data loss. After rounding timestamps, we added an explicit date column for convenient grouping by day.</span>
<span id="cb43-145"><a href="#cb43-145"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-146"><a href="#cb43-146"></a>We then generated a summary of missing data for each day. Implicit gaps (intervals where the device should have recorded data but did not) were converted into explicit missing entries using LightLogR’s gap-handling functions. We also removed days that had very little data to focus on days with substantial wear time. In our <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> example, days with <span class="sc">\&lt;</span>1&nbsp;hour of recordings were dropped. This threshold should be adjusted based on how much complete days matter for a given analysis at hand. E.g., in circadian science, the metrics of *interdaily stability* and *intradaily variation* require measurements for each hour of the day.</span>
<span id="cb43-147"><a href="#cb43-147"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-148"><a href="#cb43-148"></a>After these preprocessing steps, the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> dataset had no irregular timestamps remaining and contained explicit markers for all periods of missing data (e.g., times when the device was off or not worn). The distance and illuminance values were now ready for metric calculations. Because the device was put in <span class="in">`sleep mode`</span> when not worn, there are no measurements during non-wear times. </span>
<span id="cb43-149"><a href="#cb43-149"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-150"><a href="#cb43-150"></a>The <span class="in">`VEET`</span> illuminance data underwent a similar cleaning procedure. To make the <span class="in">`VEET`</span>’s 2-second illuminance data more comparable to the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span>’s and to reduce computational load, we aggregated the illuminance time series to 5-second intervals. Aggregation was performed with the arithmetic mean of values in a 5-second bin. We then inserted explicit missing entries for each whole day and removed days with more than one hour of missing illuminance data. After cleaning, six days of <span class="in">`VEET`</span> illuminance data with good coverage remained for analysis (see <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supplement 1</span><span class="co">](supplement.qmd)</span> for details).</span>
<span id="cb43-151"><a href="#cb43-151"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-152"><a href="#cb43-152"></a>Finally, for spectral analysis, we imported the <span class="in">`VEET`</span>’s spectral sensor modality, and, for the distance analysis, the time-of-flight modality. This required additional processing: the raw spectral data consists of counts from 10 wavelength-specific channels (approximately 415&nbsp;nm through 940&nbsp;nm, unequally spaced between 30 and 50 nm, plus one broadband clear channel covering the whole range of individual channels and a dark channel) along with a sensor gain setting. We aggregated the spectral data to 5-minute intervals to focus on broader trends and reduce data volume. Each channel’s counts were normalized by the appropriate gain. Using a calibration matrix provided by the manufacturer (specific to the spectral sensor model), we reconstructed full spectral power distributions for each 5-minute interval. The end result is a list-column in the dataset where each entry is the estimated spectral irradiance across wavelengths for that time interval. Detailed spectral preprocessing steps, including the calibration and normalization, are provided in the <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">Supplement 1</span><span class="co">](supplement.qmd)</span>. After spectral reconstruction, the dataset was ready for calculating example spectrum-based metrics.</span>
<span id="cb43-153"><a href="#cb43-153"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-154"><a href="#cb43-154"></a>Similarly, the time-of-flight modality contains 256 values per observation, encoding an 8x8 grid of distance and confidence measurements for up to two objects (8x8 grid, times two objects, times distance + confidence column for each object and grid point -&gt; 256 values). For computational reasons, only the first object was kept. These data were pivoted into a long format, where each row contains the distance and confidence data for a given position in the grid and a given datetime. After pivoting and converting grid positions into a deviation angle from central view, the dataset was ready to be used for distance analysis.</span>
<span id="cb43-155"><a href="#cb43-155"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-156"><a href="#cb43-156"></a>Because the <span class="in">`VEET`</span> devices record even when not worn, a non-wear detection using the devices' actigraphy modality was implemented. This process used the standard deviation of a linear motion sensor in a 5-minute bin with a visually derived threshold to separate wear from non-wear time. Measurements of illuminance and distance were consequently removed during the calculated non-wear times.</span>
<span id="cb43-157"><a href="#cb43-157"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-158"><a href="#cb43-158"></a>This tutorial will start by importing a <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> dataset and providing an overview of the data. The <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> export is considerably simpler compared to the <span class="in">`VEET`</span> export, only containing <span class="in">`Distance`</span> and <span class="in">`Illuminance`</span> measurements. The <span class="in">`VEET`</span> dataset will be imported later for the spectrum related metrics.</span>

<span id="cb43-185"><a href="#cb43-185"></a>We first examine metrics related to viewing distance, using the processed <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> dataset.

Using <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">extract_clusters()</span><span class="co">](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/extract_clusters.html)</span> with those parameters, we count how many such episodes occur per day.</span>

<span id="cb43-572"><a href="#cb43-572"></a>To use these distance data in the framework shown above for the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> device, a sensible method to condense the data has to be applied. There are many ways how a spatially resolved distance measure could be utilized for analysis:</span>
<span id="cb43-573"><a href="#cb43-573"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-574"><a href="#cb43-574"></a><span class="ss">- </span>Where in the field of view are objects in close range?</span>
<span id="cb43-575"><a href="#cb43-575"></a><span class="ss">- </span>How large are near objects in the field of view?</span>
<span id="cb43-576"><a href="#cb43-576"></a><span class="ss">- </span>How varied are distances within the field of view?</span>
<span id="cb43-577"><a href="#cb43-577"></a><span class="ss">- </span>How close are objects / is viewing distance in a region of interest within the field of view?</span>
<span id="cb43-578"><a href="#cb43-578"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-579"><a href="#cb43-579"></a>Possible methods include:</span>
<span id="cb43-580"><a href="#cb43-580"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-581"><a href="#cb43-581"></a><span class="ss">- </span>average across all (high confidence) distance values within the grid</span>
<span id="cb43-582"><a href="#cb43-582"></a><span class="ss">- </span>closest (high confidence) distance within the grid</span>
<span id="cb43-583"><a href="#cb43-583"></a><span class="ss">- </span>(high confidence) values at or around a given grid position, e.g., ±10 degrees around the central view (0°)</span>
<span id="cb43-584"><a href="#cb43-584"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-585"><a href="#cb43-585"></a>Many more options are available based on the spatial dataset, e.g., condensation rules based on the number of points in the grid with a given condition, or the variation within the grid.</span>
<span id="cb43-586"><a href="#cb43-586"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-587"><a href="#cb43-587"></a>We will demonstrate these three methods for a single day (<span class="in">`2024-06-10`</span>), all leading to a data structure akin to the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span>, i.e., to be used for further calculation of visual experience metrics.</span>

To better illustrate light exposure metrics, we turn to a different dataset, this one taken from the <span class="in">`VEET`</span> device’s illuminance data, which capture a broader range of lighting conditions (though both device types are able to capture broadly the same range of illuminance).

The <span class="in">`VEET`</span> illuminance histogram (see @fig-hist-VEETlight) shows a heavily skewed distribution with a considerable number of zero lx values (indicating intervals of complete darkness or the sensor being covered) and a long tail extending to very high lux values.

<span id="cb43-728"><a href="#cb43-728"></a>However, because illuminance data tend to be extremely skewed and contain many zero values (periods of darkness), the arithmetic mean can be <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">misleading</span><span class="co">](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/articles/log.html)</span>. A common approach is to apply a logarithmic transform to illuminance before averaging, which down-weights extreme values and accounts for the multiplicative nature of light intensity effects. LightLogR provides helper functions <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">`log_zero_inflated()`</span><span class="co">]</span>((https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/log_zero_inflated.html)) and its inverse <span class="co">[</span><span class="ot">`exp_zero_inflated()`</span><span class="co">](https://tscnlab.github.io/LightLogR/reference/log_zero_inflated.html)</span> to handle log-transformation when zeros are present (by adding a small offset before log, and back-transforming after averaging). Using this approach, we recompute the daily mean illuminance. The results in @tbl-lightexposure2 show that the log-transformed mean (back-transformed to lux) is much lower, reflecting the fact that for much of the time illuminance was near zero. This transformed mean is often more representative of typical exposure for skewed data.</span>

If we wanted to analyse the <span class="in">`VEET`</span> data together with the <span class="in">`Clouclip`</span> data, for example, we would not have to rename anything, as both carry their illuminance measurements in the variable <span class="in">`Lux`</span>.

<span id="cb43-1117"><a href="#cb43-1117"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-1118"><a href="#cb43-1118"></a>This tutorial demonstrates a standardized, step-by-step pipeline to calculate a variety of visual experience metrics. We illustrated how a combination of LightLogR functions and tidyverse workflows can yield clear and reproducible analyses for wearable device data. While the full pipeline is detailed, each metric is computed through a dedicated sequence of well-documented steps, yet remains configurable to realize different metric definitions or thresholds. </span>
<span id="cb43-1119"><a href="#cb43-1119"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-1120"><a href="#cb43-1120"></a>By leveraging LightLogR’s framework alongside common data analysis approaches, the process remains transparent and relatively easy to follow. The overall goal is to make analysis transparent (with open-source functions), accessible (through thorough documentation, tutorials, and human-readable function naming, all under an MIT license), robust (the package includes &gt;900 unit tests and continuous integration with bug tracking on GitHub), and community-driven (open feature requests and contributions via GitHub).</span>
<span id="cb43-1121"><a href="#cb43-1121"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-1122"><a href="#cb43-1122"></a>Even with standardized pipelines, researchers must still make and document many decisions during data cleaning, time-series handling, and metric calculations — especially for complex metrics that involve grouping data in multiple ways (for example, grouping by distance range as well as by duration for cluster metrics). We have highlighted these decision points in the tutorial (such as how to handle irregular intervals, choosing thresholds for “near” distances or “outdoor” light, and deciding on minimum durations for sustained events). Explicitly considering and reporting these choices is important for reproducibility and for comparing results across studies.</span>
<span id="cb43-1123"><a href="#cb43-1123"></a></span>
<span id="cb43-1124"><a href="#cb43-1124"></a>The broad set of features in LightLogR — ranging from data import and cleaning tools (for handling time gaps and irregularities) to visualization functions and metric calculators — make it a powerful toolkit for visual experience research. Our examples spanned circadian-light metrics and myopia-related metrics, demonstrating the versatility of a unified analysis approach. By using community-supported tools and workflows, researchers in vision science, chronobiology, myopia, and related fields can reduce time spent on low-level data wrangling and focus more on interpreting results and advancing scientific understanding.</span>
